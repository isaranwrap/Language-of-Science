The key assumption of managerial revolution theory-that ownership is separated
from control in large corporations-has important consequences for theories of
class structure and economic development. If managers do not act in the interest
of proprietors, theories based on property ownership are obsolete. Furthermore,
the growth patterns of capitalist societies would be altered if large corporations
protect managerial interests rather than owner interests. We examined
managerial revolution theory by studying the relationship between the dismissal
of corporate chiefs and various structural variables (including five measures of
manager/owner control) for 286 of the 300 largest industrial firms in 1964. Our
results do not support managerial revolution theory. Profit performance most
affects the probability that the chief will be fired, and type of control has little
effect. Profit performance appears to be an effective constraint on the behavior of
both managerially-controlled and owner-controlled firms.
historic relation to both kinship and prop-
erty as such.” In their view, a class of
managers and professionals has displaced
the capitalist class, whose members’
power and privilege derived from
ownership of wealth and productive prop-
erty (Berle and Means, 1932; Burnham,
1962). While capitalists’ power had been
based on ownership of productive prop-
erty, the power of the new professional
class was derived from its members’ tech-
nical competence (Bell, 1976:294—295;
Parsons, 1971:104; Galbraith,
1971:74-84), which qualified them for key
administrative positions (Lenski,
1966:352; Dahrendorf, 1959:256; Giddens,
1973:167-176). According to these
theorists, industrial organization is not
subordinated to economic imperatives;
positions in organizations determine
wealth, rather than the reverse. As Gal-
braith puts it, ‘‘The decisive power in
modern society is exercised not by capital
but by organization, not by the capitalist
but by the industrial bureaucrat’’
(1971:xvii).

Second, the ascendance of the corpo-
rate manager has freed the corporation to
pursue goals other than the profit-
maximizing strategies of the entrepre-
neurial firm. It is argued that managers are
motivated to guide the firm in directions
which maximize returns to managers
rather than to stockholders. Thus, mana-
gerial corporations are slow to innovate,
and tend to shun risk. They adopt strate-
gies which favor steady growth and allow
high salaries for management. Manageri-
alists disagree on what those strategies
might be but agree that the interests of
owners and managers diverge (Samuel-
son, 1973:112—5S). Schumpeter (1950: 156)
saw the supersession of owners, who were
motivated to innovate in order to reap
profits, by managers, who acquire
‘‘something of the psychology of the
salaried employee working in a bureau-
cratic organization,’’ as presaging the de-
mise of capitalism. Eugene V. Rostow
(1959:71) was so concerned that managers
might not be motivated to act in the inter-
ests of owners that he suggested the im-
plementation of ‘‘profit maximization as a
legal principle.” Monsen and Downs
(1965:256) argue that
Presumably, property linked by family
ties creates a sufficient community of
interest to ensure coordinated action in
defense of that property. However, the
business press is replete with reported
examples of the profit-seeking behavior of
managers which exists without any visible
intervention by owning families. Some
authors have suggested that positive in-
centives, such as stock-option plans,
higher salaries, and the like, tend to create
in managers motivations which resemble
those of entrepreneurs (e.g., Child,
1969:40,46). This research focuses on the
relationship between firm profitability and
the firing of corporate chiefs. Further, we
suggest that the structural imperative to
maintain ‘‘adequate’’ firm profitability,
enforced through the negative sanction of
firing, may be the one constraint which
most effectively guarantees the protection
of proprietary interests.

Zeitlin (1976:902) observes that the
theory of managerialism rests on an even
more basic theory that managers and
owners have contradictory motivations. If
managers are prevented from acting
against the interests of owners regardless
of divergent motivations between these two
groups, then theories of class structure or
economic development based on manage-
rial motivations are seriously com-
promised. In our view, social structural
positions and their associated imperatives
have a logical causal priority over the
motivations of the individuals who are
selected to fill those positions. Before the
rise of the large stock corporation, indi-
viduals who filled the roles of entrepre-
neurs were probably motivated to realize
profits. If they did not act as if they were
so motivated, however, the failure of their
firms would eventually remove them from
those positions. The negative sanc-
tion—of economic failure—tended to en-
sure that individual entrepreneurs had
the proper motivation to retain their posi-
tions. Thus, the behavior exhibited by
entrepreneurs was a structural require-
ment of the position of entrepreneur itself
rather than merely a function of the moti-
vation of individuals who became entre-
preneurs.

Similarly, if managers are fired when
their firms fail to maintain adequate prof-
its, it is likely that persons who come to
occupy managerial positions tend to be
motivated to enhance firm profitability.
Even if they are not so motivated, they
must act as if they are if they wish to
remain in their positions of authority.

Yet what mechanisms ensure that cor-
porate chiefs are removed from office
when profits disappear or decline? Zeitlin
(1974) argues that familial ties and other
personal associations coordinate the ac-
tions of propertied individuals against re-
calcitrant managers who compromise the
profitability of their firms. While this
mechanism may be the ultimate sanction,
other plausible mechanisms are probably
activated first. Low profit rates make
managers more vulnerable both to
‘‘palace coups’’ by coalitions of ‘‘insid-
ers”’ (see, e.g., Zald and Berger, 1978) and
to unfriendly takeovers by other corpo-
rations. Either of these processes could
remove the incumbent from effective
control of the firm without any interven-
tion by principal owners.

Accordingly, the specific question ad-
dressed by this research is: How immune
are the managers of large corporations to
corporate profitability constraints? If the
top managers of both owner-controlled
and manager-controlled firms are re-
moved for poor profit performance at ap-
proximately the same rates, then it would
seem reasonable to conclude that pro-
prietary interests are being protected even
in those firms which are judged to be
Several investigators have published their
evaluations of the degree of managerial
control which existed in large United
States corporations at various times be-
tween 1959 and 1970: Villarejo (1961/1962)
for the year 1959; Larner (1970) for 1963;
Burch (1972) and Chevalier (1970) for
1964; Pederson and Tabb (1976) for
1969-1970. In order to take advantage of
these measures of type of control and to
minimize the error introduced by using
measures for years other than the year of
our investigation, we studied firings which
occurred during 1965. The sample uni-
verse was the 300 largest industrial corpo-
rations, based on 1964 sales. On the aver-
age, 1964 and 1965 were good years for
business; both were on the expansion side
of an economic cycle which began about
1961 and lasted until the end of the dec-
ade.

We used the business press to deter-
mine which of these firms discharged their
chiefs during 1965. Probit analysis was
then used to estimate the probability of a
chief’s being fired as a function of two
measures of firm profitability, two mea-
sures of firm market-power, and the vari-
ous measures of type of control mentioned
earlier.

We restricted our sample to industrial
corporations in order to minimize com-
parability problems because other types of
corporations, such as transportation com-
panies and public utilities, face different
contingencies, such as much closer regu-
lation.

A relatively large sample was required
to guarantee an adequate number of fir-
If the process by which chiefs are re-
moved were the same as the process of
firing workers and lower level managers,
defining the dismissal of the chief would
pose no problem. However, removal of
the chief is not merely a matter of calling
the unfortunate into the office and telling
him to clean out his desk or locker. For
one thing, firings of top management per-
sonnel are never called firings. Chief ex-
ecutives and companies usually prefer to
treat the matter delicately; hence, gener-
ally, ‘‘resignations’’ are accepted, or
“early retirements”’ are taken, but firings
do not occur. Another difference between
dismissal of a lower participant and that of
the chief is that the firing often requires
more than a simple, straightforward exer-
cise of authority: an owner can fire a man-
ager; but, when a corporation is not
closely held, the process is more compli-
cated. It might require formation of a coa-
lition of powerful outsiders (stockholders,
bankers, outside directors). Firings might
occur quickly in the form of a coup (Zald
and Berger, 1978), but, in some cases, they
might require long, drawn-out processes.
For example, Mace (1971:32—3) reports a
case in which a group of outside directors
persuaded the CEO to call in a profes-
sional consulting firm. The consultants
recommended that the president step up
to the position of chairman of the board,
and that a new president, then, be brought
in from outside the company. The presi-
dent accepted the recommendation. It
seems as if either one of two conditions
must hold for a firing to occur: a coalition
must form for the purpose of bringing
about a firing; or there must be an owner
who is capable of ordering a firing. So, we
define a firing as a particular type of man-
agement succession which was initiated
by others and in which, at the outset of the
process, the chief did not intend to leave
(this definition, therefore, includes being
persuased to step down by consultants,
associates, or powerful outsiders, and it
excludes voluntary departures for better
jobs).

Identification of firings was a two-stage
procedure. We checked the firms for an
indication of any change in position
holders during 1965. Firms which had no
change required no further research.
Focusing, therefore, on each remaining
corporation, we determined whether there
was a change in the position of its chief
executive officer, and, if so, whether or
not it was a firing.

The names of the chairmen, presidents,
and chief executive officers of the top 300
firms in the 1965 Moody’s Industrial Man-
ual were compared to the 1966 Moody’s
listing of the incumbents of those posi-
tions. About 190 corporations (62% of the
final sample of 286) showed no change.
Any corporation which had changed an
occupant of even one of those three posi-
tions was selected for more detailed
study.' We researched the 110 remaining
corporations in the 1965 issues of the New
York Times, Forbes, Fortune, and Busi-
ness Week. The Wall Street Journal,
Dun’s Review, Time, and Newsweek were
used to supplement these four. About 60
of the 110 were eliminated rather easily. In
these cases, one or two articles on the
management change established that the
change did not involve the chief, or, if it
did involve the chief, the management
change was not a firing. We then studied,
more intensively, the 50 remaining poten-
tial firings. Sometimes the process of
easing out a chief takes several years (and
the story might not come out until even
several years after that). For this reason,
we followed corporations in the business
press as long as was necessary to establish
the nature of the personnel change (usu-
ally about three years, but sometimes
longer).

Although the identity of the chief was
seldom unambiguous, business-press arti-
cles always provided some information on
the persons in charge. A story often sim-
ply stated that a particular person was
chief. Sometimes, an article identified the
person who fired other major officers.
Sometimes, an executive who was inter-
viewed made the identity of the chief
clear. When articles noted major changes,
they often identified the persons who ini-
tiated the changes.

The clues which we used to isolate fir-
ings were of several types. If the chief
were 65, and if the reports of the succes-
sion emphasized that he was retiring and
that his handpicked successor was as-
suming the top position, we considered
the succession to be an orderly one.
Changes reported as being due to death or
illness were not judged to be firings. When
the chief resigned before reaching retire-
ment age and there was indication that the
resignation was involuntary, we judged
the change to be a firing. Other real indi-
cations, to us, of firings were very un-
friendly atmospheres surrounding the
change and sweeping policy changes by
the successor. Because we hypothesize a
connection between performance and fir-
ing, we did not use evidence about per-
formance in our criteria for identification
of firings. We classified sixteen companies
as probable firings and ten as possible fir-
ings, although in the analyses reported
here we concentrated on the sixteen prob-
able firings and coded the ten possible
firings as ‘‘not fired.”

Hence, it appears that over 5%—and
maybe as much as one-tenth of the final
sample—were, individually, in the pro-
cess of firing a chief during 1965. It is
interesting that so many dismissals were
taking place even after a good year. The
mean 1964 profit rate for the sample com-
panies was 10.9%, and the mean dif-
ference in profit rate (1964 rate minus the
1962 rate) was a net increase of 1.2%.
complete. That study (Larner, 1970) as-
sumed that at least 10% of a firm’s stock
has to be under control of a group of
stockholders for the firm to be classified
as owner-controlled. Two other studies
(Palmer, 1972; Sheehan, 1967), also using
a 10% cut-off, found that about 30% of
large industrials were under minority
control. Four studies (Burch, 1972;
Chevalier, 1970; Villarejo: 1961/62; Kotz,
1975) using a 5% criterion found that a
solid majority (clustering around 60%) of
large industrials were not management-
controlled. Two other investigations
(Lundberg, 1968; Pederson and Tabb,
1976) concluded that almost no corpo-
rations were under control of nonowning
management.

The concept of corporate control has
two distinct aspects: the potential for
control and the actual exercise of control
in a concrete situation. All nine of the
studies reviewed briefly investigated the
potential for control. By contrast, this
study examines the actual exercise of
control without consideration for whether
the action originated with owners or man-
agers. Although a number of circum-
stances might lead to the dismissal of a
corporate chief, the phenomenon under
investigation is clearly one in which man-
agerial and proprietary interests are in
conflict. At the least, it is unlikely that the
personal interests of the manager in ques-
tion are being served if he is being sac-
rificed because of low firm profitability.

Of the nine studies mentioned, five
published their evaluations of the degree
of managerial control of each of the firms
in their samples. We have collapsed their
more elaborate categories into
dichotomies where 0 represents manage-
rial control and 1 represents owner con-
trol.?
Profit performance. Our principal hy-
pothesis is that corporate chiefs are likely
to be fired if their firms fail to perform
acceptably. Firm profitability is an im-
portant and measurable dimension of that
performance. The best measure of profit is
probably net income as a proportion of
invested capital. Industrial organ-
izationists justify this measure on the fol-
lowing grounds: (1) net income (after tax
income) reflects the income a company
receives better than other measures of
return; (2) the measure is less susceptible
to year-to-year fluctuations and account-
ing legerdemain; (3) because the denomi-
nator is invested capital, the measure
better reflects what shareholders would
wish to maximize than do other measures
(Hall and Weiss, 1970:319-20; Shepherd,
1975:298; Scherer, 1970:80). To measure
profit rate we used net income as a pro-
portion of invested capital for 1964. To
measure profit-rate increase we arbitrarily
chose a two-year interval and subtracted
the 1962 profit-rate measure from the 1964
profit-rate measure. The expected direc-
tion of the relationships is negative be-
tween both measures of profit perform-
ance and the firing rate.

Size and market position. A firm’s ca-
pacity to control its environment should
lead to greater managerial autonomy and
internal stability (Galbraith, 1971:87—95).
Because size and market position are two
of the principal dimensions of control over
environment, they will be added to the
model predicting’ firings. There is no sys-
tematic empirical work on the conditions
affecting firing, but there is a rationale for
the expected relationship between firing
and market position and size. Companies’
incentives for effective managerial per-
formance can be dichotomized as positive
sanctions, (e.g., salary, stock options), or
negative sanctions (primarily firings). As
Wright (1976) points out, firms emphasize
rewards for managers and negative sanc-
tions for workers. Firms would rather not
fire managers, especially top managers,
because firing disrupts operations (see
Grusky, 1961, for a similar argument with
respect to succession). A firing can initiate
significant disruptive policy changes.
When it becomes necessary, however,
firms will resort to firings. Large
monopoly firms enjoy the ‘‘quiet life,’’
compared to smaller firms. Because they
are able to control and monitor their envi-
ronment’ more effectively, they might not
need to overhaul their operations as often
as (relatively) smaller firms which face a
more competitive situation. Conse-
quently, firms which control their envi-
ronments (i.e., larger firms which operate
in oligopolistic markets) could be ex-
pected to dismiss their chiefs less often.

We used total assets to operationalize
corporate size. The effects of size are
probably not linear. We expect that the
stability of the chief’s tenure increases at a
diminishing rate with the increase in size.
Size was operationalized as inverse total
assets in order to provide a convenient
nonlinear transformation which would ex-
press diminishing returns.

We used Palmer’s (1973) measurement
of Barriers to Entry (BTE) as a measure of
market position. Palmer argues that this
measure is the best measure of a firm’s
market position. BTE represents the con-
cept better than do concentration ratios
because it takes into account potential
competition and captures the effect of
monopoly power on return. Palmer’s
(1973:295-296)? measure used previous
evaluations of the heights of BTEs for
firms by
4 The logic of studying events such as the firings of
corporation executives makes it reasonable to view
them as probabilistically determined. That is, there is
no reason to believe that all corporations would re-
spond in the same way to different levels of the
independent variables described here (as well as to
many other systematic and/or situational factors not
considered here). In fact, although corporations may
tend to react to stimuli in the same manner, firings
would probably occur at different critical levels on
these variables. It is plausible that the critical levels
at which firing occurs vary across corporations ac-
cording to some probability distribution. For each
corporation there are many factors which determine
the critical level at which a firing takes place; many
such factors are at the individual level of analysis and
are not addressed by structural theories such as ours.
In cases with many causal factors, such as this one,
the normal distribution can be justified on the basis
of the central limit theorem (Theil, 1971:630). When
studying a relatively rare event, correct specification
of the underlying probability process is necessary in
order to guard against incorrect inferences. We
therefore decided to analyze our data by probit
analysis. This procedure assumes that the event
under investigation (in our case, the firing of a chief)
follows a cumulative normal distribution function. It
then estimates the relationship between the proba-
bility of the event with a linear function of the inde-
pendent variables by a maximum-likelihood estima-
tion procedure. Thus, we estimate an equation such
as the following:
The same five models were estimated
for each of five corporation control mea-
sures available to us. The sample size
changes for each of the five groups be-
cause all but the Burch group had varying
numbers of missing data on the Type of
Control variable. Thus, the last four
groups are different subsamples of the
first group.

Because owner-controlled (OC) corpo-
rations were coded 1 and manager-
controlled (MC) corporations were coded
0, the Type of Control variable estimates
the difference that OC corporations expe-
rience as compared to MC corporations.
For example, the (nonsignificant) positive
.2 coefficient for Type of Control in Burch
Equation 3 implies that owner-controlled
corporations tend to fire chiefs more often
than managerially controlled corpo-
rations.

Models 1, 2 and 3 within each group are
models in which only additive relations
are assumed to hold. They provide com-
parisons for Models 4a and 4b. Models 4a
and 4b are analogous to the analysis of
covariance design within regression
analysis. The interaction variables (Col-

Are firings more likely to occur in owner-
controlled firms? Because control is often
conceptualized as the ability to remove
management, one would expect that
owners would be more likely to dislodge a
chief than would a corporate board; cor-
porate boards are supposed to be com-
posed both of insiders who are subordi-
nates of the chief and of sympathetic out-
side directors who are selected by him.

The first group of models uses the re-
sults of Phillip Burch’s (1972) study for
measurement of the ownership-
management variable. In Model 1, Profit
Increase is significantly associated with
the probability of firing. Hence, firms with
profit drops are more likely to fire the
chief. G? (Column 8) is statistically signifi-
cant, so the model improves on the model
of random firings. Model 2, in addition to
including the Net Profit Increase measure,
adds the two measures of monopoly
power to the equation, and the size vari-
able is statistically significant. (The G?
was not significant, but would have been if
the degrees of freedom had been reduced
by inclusion of the BTE variable.) Model 3
adds Type of Control, which is nonsig-
nificant, and does not improve on Model 2
(AG? not significant).

The results for the interaction models
(4a and 4b) are surprising, but are not con-
sistent with managerial theory. Model 4a
seems to support the managerial revolu-
tion hypothesis with a nonsignificant
coefficient for the Profit Rate variable
(applying to managers only) and a nega-
tive term for the associated interaction
(applying to owners only) which is statis-
tically significant. At the same time,
Model 4b supports exactly the opposite
conclusion for the Net Profit Rate In-
crease variable. In fact, if both interac-
tions are included in the same equation,
both remain statistically significant with
the same signs.’ One could conclude on
the basis of the Burch equations that OC
coprorations fire their chiefs for low profit
levels more readily than do MC corpo-
rations, but that MC corporations fire their
chiefs when profit rates decline sooner
than do OC corporations. Thus, the Burch
equations provide little comfort for mana-
gerial theory and suggest that perform-
ance constraints on the behavior of the
chiefs of MC corporations, rather than
being nonexistent, are merely a different
function of profits.

The remaining models of Table 1(for the
other measures of the type of control vari-
able) provide even less support for
theories of the managerial revolution.
Only one other interaction term was
statistically significant (Pederson and Tabb
Model 4b), and it was in the opposite di-
rection from that predicted by managerial
theory.° In fact, five of the remaining eight
interaction terms have signs opposite to
those predicted by managerial theory. By
contrast, the Profit Rate variable always
had the expected sign in Models 1, 2, and
3 and was statistically significant in the
Chevalier models. The Profit Rate In-
crease variable had the expected sign in all
Models 1 through 3 except the Chevalier
models (in which the Profit Level coeffi-
cient was significant), and was statistically
significant in the Villarejo models and in
Larner Models 2 and 3.’

Somewhat surprisingly, the effect of
corporation size was not in the direction
we expected. In all of our samples, larger
corporations tended to fire more often
than smaller ones, and this effect was
often statistically significant. A post hoc
explanation might be that competition for
the top office is greater in larger corpo-
rations and, therefore, results in higher
firing rates. More importantly for the pre-
sent purposes, monopoly power doesn’t
appear to reduce the effects of proft con-
straints on corporate chiefs.®

The major conclusion of our analysis,
up to this point, is that profitability con-
siderations still appear to be effective con-
straints on the behavior of corporate
chiefs whether or not their firms are
manager-controlled or owner-controlled.
Why did we find so little support for man-
agerial theory? One possibility is that ex-
cessive error in the measurement of Type
of Control has seriously attenuated our
estimate of its effect. The availability of
five different measures of Type of Control
suggests that, to the extent that they mea-
sure the same latent factor, models which
take measurement error into account
might be constructed. Unfortunately,
statistical theory and computational al-
gorithms which incorporate probits into a
latent structure approach are yet to be
developed. Log-linear models might be
used but would require grouping of con-
tinuous variables with an attendant loss of
information. Because of these problems,
we decided to assess the measurement
error problem through a more circuitous
route.

First, we investigated the possibility
that the five measures of control were in-
dicators of a common factor by factor
analyzing the Type of Control correlation
matrix.? Second, assuming that the five
measures tapped a common dimension of
corporate control, we created a Type of
Control scale and reestimated the probit
equations of Table 1. Finally, we assumed
that the five measures were independent
indicators of different aspects of corporate
control and reestimated the equations
with all five measures included simulta-
neously. Comparison of these analyses
allows a judgment of the likelihood that
measurement error has seriously at-
tenuated the estimate of the effect of cor-
porate control.

Data for all five Type of Control mea-
sures were available for 160 of the 286
firms in our sample. (All of these 160 were
among the largest 200 firms.) Fourteen of
the 160 were classified as firms in which
firings occurred. This reduction in sample
size apparently did not introduce large
distortions in the pattern of relationships.
Table 2 contains the product-moment cor-
relation matrix obtained when firms with
any missing data are excluded. These cor-
relations are usually within .03 of the
value obtained by pairwise deletion of
missing data and are never more than .07
different.

The factor structure of the Type of
Control variables was estimated using
confirmatory factor analysis (S6rbom and
Jéreskog, 1976) and no plausible one- or
two-factor model provided a reasonably
satisfactory fit to the data. Excessive re-
duction in degrees of freedom precluded
estimation of models with more than two
factors. Although binary data do not
match the assumptions required by this
factor analysis procedure, the degree of
misfit was so high for all models consid-
ered that it seemed unlikely that the data
could be characterized by a simple latent
structure (Kim and Rabjohm, 1979:142).

Even though the five Type of Control
measures did not exhibit a simple factor
structure, we created a Type of Control
scale by simple summation of the individ-
ual Type of Control scores. Kim and
Rabjohm (1979:154) report that this pro-
cedure compares favorably with dif-
ferential weighting of individual scores
according to factor scores. Of course, in
our case, the absence of a single factor
solution precluded the differential
weighting of scores.

The relationship between the proba-
bility of firing, the Type of Control scale,
and the remaining independent variables
produced the results reported in Table 3.
As was usually the case, one of the per-
formance variables, this time Profit Level,
has strong, statistically significant effects
even when all other variables are con-
trolled. Furthermore, the interaction
models produce no significant improve-
ment over Model 3. Managerially con-
trolled firms appear to be as effective as
owner-controlled firms in protecting pro-
prietary interests—at least as far as firm
profitability is concerned.

As a further test, we assumed that the
five Type of Control measures reflected
different aspects of corporate control;
therefore, by including all of them in one
probit equation, we estimated their joint
effect on the probability of firing. As is
indicated in Table 4, the simultaneous ef-
fect of all five control measures did not
produce a significant increment to G?, net
of the effect of the performance variables.
Similarly, the interaction terms did not
improve the fit of the models. This ap-
proach provides no support for the
managerial-revolution thesis. In sum, it
appears unlikely that measurement error
is the cause of the weakness of the Type of
Control measures used in this study. In-
dependently, they have little or no effect
on the probability of firing. Even if they
are assumed to be indicators of a common
factor, they do not produce significant in-
teractions with the performance variables
as managerial theory implies.
profit-‘‘satisficing’’ rather than profit-
maximizing behavior, but how are the
chiefs of these corporations to determine
when they have obtained an adequate
level of profits and can afford to relax and
maximize their own utility function or,
perhaps, guide their firms in more ‘‘soul-
ful’’ directions? If there is great variability
in the profit performance of firms which
fire their chiefs, one can infer that corpo-
rate chiefs who are not fired might be re-
luctant to abandon profit-maximizing be-
haviors. The remainder of this discussion
will provide a preliminary evaluation of
the extent to which firms with apparently
adequate profit performance are substan-
tially free of profitability constraints.
Among those firms which were judged
as probably having fired their chiefs, there
is wide variation in the two profitability
measures. Only two of the 286 firms in the
full sample had negative profit rates in
1964, and only one of those two was in-
volved in a firing. Three of the sixteen
firings had profit rates above the 1964 av-
erage, and six of the sixteen had above-
average increases in profit rates. One of
the firms judged to have fired its chief had
a profit rate of nearly 30%; only two firms
in the entire sample had higher rates. For
the full 286 firm sample, the standard de-
viation of the 1964 profit level was 9% for
the fired group and 5% for the nonfired
group; the corresponding figures for the
Profit Rate Increase variable were 7% and
3%, respectively. Only one of the ten
difference-in-means tests showed a statis-
tically significant difference on a profit-
performance measure for firms which
fired their chiefs as compared to those
which did not (Tables A2 and A3). Ac-
cordingly, it would seem that a corporate
chief might have some difficulty in deter-
mining when the firm’s profit performance
was adequate enough to allow him/her to
pursue goals other than profit maximiza-
tion.

The main question here, however, is not
whether firms with widely varying levels
of profit performance fire their chiefs but
whether those firings are related to profit
performance. If firms show adequate
profit performance, yet still dismiss their
chiefs as a function of profit performance,
the managerialists’ counterargument loses
much of its force. Such a finding would
make it appear unlikely that satisfaction of
a minimum profit constraint allows man-
agers to pursue other goals.

To test the relationship between the
probability of the firing of a chief and
profit performance for firms with
seemingly adequate profit performance,
the models of Table 1 were reestimated
after excluding those firms with the
poorest records on the two performance
variables. We arbitrarily selected one
standard deviation below the mean as the
cutoff point for excluding firms. Thus,
firms with profit rates of less than 5.67%
were excluded from the analyses reported
in Table 5, and those with profit rate de-
clines of more than 2.55% were excluded
from the analyses of Table 6. Neither table
holds any surprises. When those firms
with low profit rates are excluded (Table
5), the analyses reproduce the results of
Table 1. When those firms with very high
profit-rate declines are excluded (Table 6),
the Profit Rate variable has, in each of the
five subsamples, statistically significant
effects on the probability of firing. The
We found that at least 5% of the top 300
industrial corporations dismissed the chief
executive during 1965. Poor profit per-
formance by a firm, whether or not that
firm was under managerial control, in-
creased the probability of the chief's dis-
missal. Five different measures of
manager/owner control produced no sig-
nificant change in firing rates, net of the
effect of poor profit performance. When
the five measures are combined into a
single measure of an assumed latent factor
of control, the Type of Control variable
produces no significant interaction with
profit performance as predicted by mana-
gerial theory. Furthermore, when the
poorest performing firms are excluded
from the analyses, the relationship be-
tween profit performance and the proba-
bility of the chief being fired remains very
strong. Only the Burch (1972) type of
control variable had a significant interac-
tion with 1964 profit rate as predicted by
managerial revolution theory, and that
interaction was balanced with a corre-
spondingly significant interaction with
profit-rate increase in the direction oppo-
site to that predicted. Thus, the prof-
itability constraints on manager-
controlled firms appear to have been a
function of the change in profit rates
rather than profit rate, per se, as was the
case with owner-controlled firms. How-
ever, even this difference between the two
types of firms disappeared when those
firms with the largest profit declines are
excluded from the analysis. Support for
managerial theory in these data appears

tenuous, at best. Of all the factors exam-
ined, poor profit performance is the
strongest and most consistent determinant
of the firing of corporate chiefs, regardless
of the Type of Control.

These results have serious implications
for theories based upon the assumption
that large corporations’ ownership and
control have been radically divorced.
First of all, ownership of productive prop-
erty may still be an important determinant
of social class. The argument which rea-
sons that a new managerial class has dis-
placed a property-based capitalist class
loses much of its force if managers are
precluded by structural imperatives from
acting decisively against the interests of
owners.

Second, the criteria which govern eco-
nomic development in advanced capitalist
societies have not been decisively altered
by the dispersion of stock ownership and
the separation of ownership from admin-
istration. Profit criteria appear to be the
most important standard by which corpo-
rate chiefs are judged, and dismissal is the
ultimate sanction which conditions their
behavior. Accordingly, it seems unlikely
that political pressure or other social pro-
cesses have deflected corporate perform-
ance toward more socially responsible
ends. If managers who fail to bring in high
earnings are fired, they cannot be ex-
pected to put social responsibility before
profitability. The behavior of business
firms cannot be reduced to the motiva-
tions of their leaders. Profit imperatives
constrain the behavior of the large firm.

Finally, this study provides no evidence
that these limits are broader for the lead-
ers of managerially controlled firms than
they are for those under the direct control
of owners.

Notes: * indicates that mean profit level for fired

expectations.

4-4 Indicate pairs of means whose difference is
statistically significant at the .05 level of significance
by 2-tailed t test.
Statistically significant differences in mean profit
level or profit increase were obtained for owner-
controlled or managerially controlled firms for any of
the five measures. In fact, managerially controlled
firms had slightly higher, though nonsignificant,
profit levels (Table A2). Owner-controlled firms
sometimes had larger mean profit increases between
1963 and 1965 but not large enough ones to reach the
average profit levels of the managerially controlled
firms.

Although we believe that poor profit performance
is a cause of firing rather than vice versa, we have
presented the mean levels of the performance vari-
ables by tenure of the chief for illustrative purposes
(Tables A2 and A3). Notice that only one firm fell
into the Manager Control—Chief Fired category for
the Pederson and Tabb sample (Table A1). This firm
enjoyed a profit level of 29% (Table A2). These re-
sults are very inconsistent with any of the other four
measures and appear to be due to chance. For these
reasons, we have little confidence in the Type of
Control or interaction effects for the Pederson and
Tabb models.
