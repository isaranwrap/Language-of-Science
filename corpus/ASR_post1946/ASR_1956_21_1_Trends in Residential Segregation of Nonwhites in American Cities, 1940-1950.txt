URING the past decade many changes

of law and administrative policy have

favored desegregation of ethnic min-
orities. A challenging question for the social
scientist is the determination of the degree
to which policy changes are followed by
changes in actual practice. To meet this
challenge three actions are necessary: (1)
the development of adequate operational
definitions of the term segregation, including
specification of the kind of segregation being
considered, (2) the invention of valid and
sensitive measures of segregation, and (3)
the application of such measurements
through time to reflect changes of practice
coincident with or consequent upon such
changes in policy.

With regard to segregation by residence
the first two steps have been taken. During
the past decade, a number of different seg-
regation indexes have been developed and
applied to American cities.1 It should now

application of one or more of these indexes
at different points in time, determine inter-
vening changes of segregation patterns.

Segregation’ by Julius Jahn, Calvin F. Schmid,
As the developer of one of the afore-
mentioned indexes, the writer proposes in
this paper to compare the degree of segrega-
tion as measured by that index in 1950 with
previously reported patterns for 1940. This
index has two advantages over any of the
others yet developed: (1) It is designed
to be used on the basis of blocks as the areal
units and thus measures segregation more
delicately than the others, all of which use
census tracts as the areal units. (2) Block
statistics are available for many more cities
than are included in the group for which
census tract data are available. From the
1950 census, block data were published for
209 cities, whereas the census tract series
included only 62 cities.

For the benefit of the reader who is un-
familiar with this index, it may be stated
briefly that the index is a ratio between the
number of blocks with no nonwhites and
the total number of blocks which would
contain no nonwhite households if the non-
whites were completely segregated and living
in the minimum possible number of blocks?
The possible range of the index is from .000
to 1.000, with .000 indicating a complete lack
of segregation and 1.000 representing com-
plete segregation.

Table 1 shows the indexes for 50 selected
cities for 1950 and for 1940 as well as the
degree of increase or decrease which took
place during the decade.
The general pattern of segregation in
1950 remained very similar to what it was
in 1940. Of the 185 cities included in both
series, Miami remained the highest. How-
ever, another Florida city, St. Petersburg,
added to the series in 1950, surpassed the
Miami score by a slight margin, .972 as
compared with .969, and Orlando was only
slightly lower with .962.

Again, as in 1940, many of the cities of
the Great Lakes area and cities along the
Mason-Dixon line ranked relatively high.

At the low end of the scale were some
suburban municipalities? such as Oak Park,
Tll., which had an index of .000. Other
cities at the low end of the scale included
many New England cities and several on
the West Coast.

With the low index in Oak Park, the range
of indices for the 209 cities in 1950 was
from .000 to .972 for St. Petersburg, or only
slightly less than the complete range of
possibility.

The degree of similarity between the seg-
regation scores in 1940 and 1950 is indicated
by Figure 1.

It is readily evident that the cases cluster
close to the diagonal line, denoting a high
positive correlation between the two years.
The product moment correlation coefficient
was actually +-.887.

Obviously had all scores remained exactly
the same, all data would have fallen on the
diagonal line. The scatter away from this
line then is indicative of the degree of change
and the direction of the change.

In general, the cities showing such marked
rises in segregation scores appeared to be
those which fell in the middle ranges of the
index in 1940, i.e., those which had only a
moderate degree of segregation in the earlier
year. The range of the 1940 scores for these
20 cities was from .309 to .782.

No city in the deep south changed as
much as .100 in either direction.

Only 7 cities had decreases of .100 or
more. Lakewood, O. showed the greatest
drop, —.369. Several other suburban munici-
palities with relatively small numbers of
nonwhites also had marked decreases. Such
changes probably signify no trend, but reflect
simply the instability of an index based on
small numbers. This is not an admission that
the index is invalid. On the contrary, the
index is a true and valid measure of the
segregation at the time of the census, re-
gardless of size of city and numbers of
nonwhites involved. However, if there are
few nonwhite households, the index must be
expected to fluctuate more widely through
time, since the movement of a few families
will produce marked changes in the index.

However, two independent cities, Madi-
son, Wis. and San Francisco, Calif., also
showed marked decreases. In the case of
San Francisco this is especially significant
in view of the fact that the adjoining cities
of Berkeley and Oakland had similar drops
in segregation scores. Apparently the San
Francisco area moved in a counter-direction
to the more prevalent tendency on the west
coast toward a tighter segregation pattern.
It would be interesting to analyze the parti-
cular factors behind these opposing tenden-
cies. One might suspect that the movement
of Negroes to western cities during the dec-
ade would tend toward more marked segre-
gation, hence higher segregation scores. On
the other hand, since this index pertains to
all non-whites, including Mongoloids, it is
possible that the dispersion of Japanese with
internment during World War II had perma-
nent effects which tended to reduce the
segregation scores in cities with heavy con-
centrations of Oriental population. This may
be the explanation of the sharp reduction
of segregation in the San Francisco area.
However, further study of the specific situa-
tion will be required to test the accuracy
of this hypothesis.

Perhaps the only consolation to be drawn
from this analysis by the proponents of
desegregation is the fact that the nation’s
capital was among those cities experiencing a
considerable reduction in the degree of segre-
gation. In Washington, the score fell from
-624 in 1940 to .540 in 1950, a drop of .084.

The cities which decreased more than
.050 manifested a wide variation in the
initial degree of segregation in 1940. The
range was from .188 to .850. Apparently the
degree of initial segregation did not deter-
mine which cities decreased.
