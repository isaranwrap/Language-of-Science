The United States has experienced a major devolution of social and
economic policy responsibilities to the states. Subnational industrial
policies to create jobs and qualitative economic growth are key to
this devolution. The authors examine the development of these pol-
icies in terms of (1) the articulation of class interests, (2) state-level
political institutions, (3) prior political legacies, (4) underlying pro-
duction regimes, and (5) interactions of strong political institutions
and class mobilization. An annual pooled cross-sectional time-series
analysis of three state-level economic development policies (entre-
preneurial, industrial recruitment, and labor market regulation)
shows that in addition to business power and strong state capacities,
the political legacies of 1930s welfare policy innovations and me-
zocorporatist bargaining potential condition the effects of business
power.
retrenchment (Zylan and Soule 2000; Pierson 1994, 2000; Huber and Ste-
phens 2001), state and local governments have adopted new proactive
economic development policies that target favored industries in an at-
tempt to improve tax bases, generate jobs, and stimulate economic growth
(Eisinger 1988, 1990, 1991, 1995; Fosler 1988; Osborne 1988; Luger and
Goldstein 1990; Hansen 1990; Schmandt and Wilson 1990; Jenkins and
Leicht 1996; Jenkins, Leicht, and Jaynes 2006; Leicht and Jenkins 1994,
1998; Saiz 2001a, 20016). All of these policies promote state intervention
in the marketplace, and many of these policies constitute direct interven-
tion as government agencies become co-investors with private enterprise
in the creation of new technology, products, and markets.

Policy researchers have neglected this growth of state-level economic
development policy as a potentially significant arena for examining state
policy. As Burstein and Linton (2002) show, recent studies of policy de-
velopment have focused almost exclusively on social policy. In this anal-
ysis, we argue that: (1) state-level economic development policies are new
and significant developments that are worthy of study in their own right,
and (2) recent theoretical developments that explain social policy can be
used to account for these state-level economic development policies.

We draw on the convergence of Hicks’s (1999; Hicks and Misra 1993)
political resource theory, Amenta’s (1998; Amenta and Halfmann 2000;
Amenta, Dunleavy, and Bernstein 1994) institutional politics theory, and
Huber and Stephens’s (2001) power constellations theory to explain the
adoption of these state-level economic development policies. All three
formulations point to the joint effects of class forces and political insti-
tutions to explain social policy. Hicks (1999) shows that working-class
mobilization combined with centralized democratic constitutions, strong
center/left parties, and neocorporatist institutions create and sustain gen-
erous welfare states. Amenta (1998) finds that strong administrations and
democratized polities mediated the effects of working- and middle-class
movements and reformed center/left parties on state-level welfare pro-
vision during the U.S. “Second New Deal.” In later work, Amenta and
Halfmann (2000) argue that democratized polities combined with strong
administrative capacities and labor unions promoted progressive sub-
national welfare policy. Huber and Stephens (2001) focus on the political
articulation of class interests and political institutions, showing that strong
center/left parties, strong unions, women’s mobilization, and neocorpor-
atist institutions interact with centralized democratic constitutions to cre-

for financial assistance. The opinions and views presented in this paper are solely those

ate strong welfare states that resist retrenchment. Strong welfare policies
also depend on and reinforce underlying production regimes and inter-
nationally competitive economies. All three perspectives argue that state
policy is a joint product of class forces and political institutions. As Huber
and Stephens put it: “State policy is the result of power relations in society
mediated by political institutions” (2001, p. 13).

Our analysis addresses two unanswered questions. First, how should
this “joint product” of class forces and political institutions be understood?
Most of this research (see Hicks and Misra 1993; Huber and Stephens
2001; Amenta et al. 1994; Amenta 1998) treats class forces and political
institutions as additive effects in regression models or uses qualitative
categorical analysis (or QCA) to capture conjunctural combinations of
class and political institutions. Yet there are additional possibilities, in-
cluding: (1) the interaction of class forces and institutions, (2) the mediation
of class effects by political institutions, and (3) class biases built into the
structure of political institutions. As Hicks argues, “infraresources [i.e.,
political institutions]. . . broadly facilitate diverse actors’ pursuits of their
interests by empowering their actions, conditioning their use of specific
instrumental resources or systematically operating to their advantage”
(1999, p. 158, emphasis added). We develop below this idea that political
institutions empower, condition, and systematically condition the effects
of class forces.

Our second question is: Can these theories developed originally to ac-
count for social policy also explain economic policy, especially direct eco-
nomic development intervention? Our answer to this is “yes” in that social
policy often includes direct consideration of the economic impact of spe-
cific measures. For example, providing more generous old-age insurance
also affects labor market participation and the number of people paying
employment tax. Policy makers considering social policies are often weigh-
ing economic development outcomes as central to their decisions. Second,
both types of policy constitute intervention in the capitalist economy and
are therefore influenced by many of the same social and institutional
constraints. The “class war” over social policy is often fought on the
grounds of economic development outcomes, making the level of class
mobilization a potential key to both policy arenas. This leads several
researchers (e.g., Cawson 1985, 1986; Katzenstein 1984; Kenworthy 1995)
to see the adoption of economic development policy as interdependent
with the adoption of social policy.

We begin with a brief discussion of these state-level development pol-
icies. We then outline arguments for the joint effects of class and insti-
tutional factors on the commitment to these policies and use pooled cross-
sectional time-series analysis to examine relevant explanations. Examining
subnational policy development poses distinctive analytic problems. Any
SUBNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES

Since the early 1970s, state governments have adopted three major strat-
egies for promoting economic development. Entrepreneurial policies make
the state a direct co-investor and business partner in the creation of new
enterprises, technologies, products, and markets. Popularly called “high
technology,” “third frontier,” and “new industrial policy,” these policies
constitute direct intervention because the state is a co-investor in private
enterprise, assuming an entrepreneurial role in key business decisions and
in the financial risks of developing new technology. The goal is qualitative
growth of high value-added production that is internationally competitive,
brings higher returns to capital and labor, and creates quality jobs and
tax revenues. The central policies are (1) public venture capital funds that
invest public funds in new products and enterprises, (2) business incu-
bators and technology research parks that provide managerial and tech-
nical assistance along with subsidized rents and financing for new high-
technology start-up enterprises, and (3) research and development tax
credits for product development. Combining what Evans (1995) calls eco-
nomic “midwifery” and “husbandry,” entrepreneurial policies require sig-
nificant discretionary decision making to evaluate market opportunities.
This is a long-term development approach that should require a decade
or more to have a significant economic impact.

Industrial recruitment policies provide incentives for existing enter-
prises to invest and expand their business operations in particular loca-
tions by lowering input production factor costs. The goal is quantitative
growth through the relocation and expansion of existing enterprises using
proven technology. These policies are largely rule based or nondiscre-
tionary since they are available to all firms that meet predefined statutory
standards but are often targeted at specific industries and sectors. They
constitute indirect intervention because the state complements private
financiers by providing subsidies for new investment. The key industrial
recruitment policies are (1) financing subsidies for new plants and equip-
ment through industrial revenue bonds, loan guarantees, and commodity
credit corporations; (2) grants for industrial site planning and preparation;
(3) tax exemptions for the purchase of new plants and equipment and
industrial inventory; (4) tax incentives for job creation and industrial
investment, including accelerated depreciation; (5) grants for worker train-
ing and recruitment; (6) public-operated industrial parks, including do-
nations of public lands for major plants; and (7) tax incentives for the
development of procurement bids. Industrial recruitment policies are a
short-term approach that optimally work within a few years to boost
employment, production, and tax revenues.

Labor market regulation policies attempt to create stability and equity
in employment and thereby create more efficient labor markets. Wage
and hour laws, fair employment codes, and protection for “closed shop”
unions are argued by some to make labor markets more efficient and to
contribute to locational quality of life (Edwards 1979). Others argue that
these policies may also be repealed as an industrial recruitment incentive
in an attempt to lower labor costs, a strategy that especially appeals to
large manufacturers and smaller business in low-wage industries (Canak
and Miller 1990). Like industrial recruitment, labor market regulation
policies are indirect interventions because they affect the input production
costs of firms and do not entail direct involvement in entrepreneurial
decisions.

Table 1 identifies the policies associated with each strategy. In earlier
work (Leicht and Jenkins 1994), a confirmatory factor analysis demon-
strated that these are distinct and coherent economic development strat-
egies. We use the annual sums of these policies to gauge the growth of
these strategies from 1971 to 1990 for the 48 contiguous states. Entre-
preneurial policies grew the most rapidly, rising from .52 programs per
state government in 1971 to 2.77 in 1990, an increase of over 400%. By
1990, only three state governments (South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyo-
ming) had no entrepreneurial policies. Industrial recruitment policies grew
from a mean of 13 programs per state government in 1971 to 20 in 1990,
a 45% increase. Starting with Mississippi’s creation of industrial revenue
bonds in 1936 and New York’s creation of general obligation and umbrella
loans in 1962, interstate competition has encouraged the steady growth
of these programs. By 1990, all state governments had some industrial
recruitment policies. Labor market regulation policies changed the least,
increasing from a mean of 2.0 programs per state government in 1971 to
2.3 in 1990 (a 15% increase) as nine state governments adopted fair em-
ployment policies, five adopted minimum-wage laws, one (Colorado) abol-
ished its minimum-wage law, and three (Colorado, Idaho, and Louisiana)
outlawed the “closed shop” with “right-to-work” laws.”

CLASS FORCES AND POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS

As discussed above, we draw on the emerging consensus among analysts
of social policy that policy development is a joint product of class forces
and political institutions. In this research, capitalist concentration, work-
ing-class mobilization, strong center/left parties, and voter turnout com-
bine with centralized regimes, neocorporatist institutions, and competitive
elections to generate welfare expenditure (Hicks 1999; Huber and Ste-
phens 2001). Amenta (1998; Amenta and Halfmann 2000; Amenta et al.
1994) found that working- and middle-class movements combined with
strong voting-rights protections, strong center/left parties, administrative
powers, and reformed political parties to produce strong subnational wel-
fare protections during the Second New Deal. This suggests a number of
additive hypotheses about the effects of class forces and political insti-
tutions on state-level economic development policies.

A second possibility is that political institutions mediate the effects of
class forces on policy outcomes. Bureaucratization, strong voting rights,
and reformed political parties mediated the effects of middle- and work-
ing-class mobilization on social welfare expenditure by state governments
during the Second New Deal in the late 1930s (Amenta et al. 1994). Below
we examine the possibility that various state capacities and electoral pro-
cesses mediate the effects of class forces on state economic development
policy. By “class forces,” we include structural power as well as mobilized
groups.

A third possibility is that political legacies (earlier policies and the class
mobilization/institutional complexes behind them) aid class mobilization
by magnifying their effects on subsequent policy outcomes (see Hicks 1999,
chap. 6; Huber and Stephens 2001, chap. 5). This may take the form of
strong path dependence as political legacies enable and constrain subse-
quent policy development, operating as a constant cause (in Stinchcombe’s
[1968] sense). For example, Hicks (1999, pp. 179-85) argues that imme-
diate post-World War II center/left governments introduced welfare pol-
icies and neocorporatist institutions that both strengthened working-class
mobilization and contributed directly to further welfare state develop-
ment. Or political legacies may have weaker mediated effects by pro-
moting class mobilization, institutional development, and production re-
gimes that have strong direct effects on policy (Huber and Stephens 2001).
If path dependence exists, political legacies will have strong direct effects
net of controls for contemporary class/institutional configurations. If me-
diation exists, legacy effects should be significantly mediated by contem-
porary class/institutional factors.

A fourth possibility is that political institutions interactively combine
with class forces to influence policy. We call this the “conjunctural” thesis
because it requires the simultaneous combination or conjuncture of po-
litical institutions and class forces to promote policy development. In
Hicks’s formulation, strong political institutions operate as infraresources
that “broadly facilitate diverse actors’ pursuit of their interests by em-
powering their actions, conditioning their use of specific instrumental
resources or systematically operating to their advantage” (1999, p. 158,
emphasis added).

Conditioning effects imply that political institutions enable mobilized
classes or groups to influence policy. For example, Kitschelt (1986) argues
that state bureaucratization provides the institutional context that allows
the environmental movement to press for proactive policies that otherwise
would be unlikely to be adopted. Framed in terms of regression analysis,
conditioning effects exist when, for example, environmental mobilization
uniquely affects policy in the presence of significant state bureaucrati-
zation. A second example is Huber and Stephens’s (2001, pp. 72-73)
analysis of the conditional effects of women’s labor force participation
on welfare expenditure. Women’s labor force participation does not affect
welfare expenditure except through the statistical interaction with left-
party strength.

A fifth possibility is that political institutions have built-in biases that
systematically favor the interests of specific classes. The welfare state
literature is replete with evidence that constitutional centralization reduces
the number of veto points that business and other privileged groups use
to block welfare development (Hicks 1999; Huber and Stephens 2001).
The capital-dependence thesis argues that state managers are systemically
constrained by the need to generate private investment to insure the cre-
ation of jobs, tax revenues, and political legitimacy (Lindblom 1977; Offe
1984; Block 1987). This leads to structural pressures to adopt probusiness
policies. Subnational governments are especially vulnerable to capital de-
pendence because of the high geographic mobility of sectors of capital,
pressuring local state managers to adopt probusiness policies without di-
rect political pressure from business (Peterson 1995; Grant 1995).

In the analysis below, we operationalize conditioning effects by using
interaction terms that combine institutions and class forces in a multiple
regression format.’ Conditioning occurs when class organization has
greater effect on policy in specific institutional contexts. Built-in or sys-
tematic biases are captured by single measures that tap institutions whose
operation favors specific classes. How do these effects translate into spe-
cific hypotheses?

Table 2 summarizes a set of hypotheses about four main determinants
of state policy: (1) the articulation of class interests and their relative unity
or fragmentation, (2) facilitative state structures, (3) prior political legacies,
and (4) underlying production regimes.

The articulation of class interests——Class explanations focus on the
power and potentially opposing interests of capitalists and workers. Busi-
ness mobilization in general should promote entrepreneurial and industrial
recruitment policies that subsidize business investment and oppose labor
market regulations that increase labor costs. A central issue here is the
organization or fragmentation of capitalist interests. In general, the greater
the business unity, the greater the pressure to adopt policies that create
a better business climate, even if these policies impose costs on specific
firms and industries (Useem 1984; Domhoff 2002). In state-level politics,
business unity is created through single peak associations (Morehouse
1981; Thomas and Hrebenar 1982), extensive business lobbying, and man-
ufacturing concentration that reduces the costs of collective action and
creates a core group to engage in classwide mobilization. A single-business
peak association allows business to speak with one voice, reducing sectoral
or “fractional” competition among business sectors. Single-business peak
associations also attempt to represent all business sectors, including small
and medium as well as large business. Business lobbyists typically dom-
inate state government, constituting half to two-thirds of all lobbyists,
controlling campaign finance and the development of most of the policy
proposals debated by the state legislature and governor’s offices (Zeigler
1983; Hunter, Wilson, and Brunk 1991; Gray and Lowery 1996). Jacobs
(1987) found that manufacturing concentration contributes to lower state-
level corporate tax rates, reflecting classwide business mobilization.

Organized labor historically has been a major supporter of labor market
regulation. Jacobs (1978) found that strong unions prevented the adoption
of state-level “right-to-work” laws and contributed to the spread of un-
employment insurance coverage in the 1960s. However, Form (1995)
found that the subsequent decline of industrial unions and the growth of
public sector unions weakened the political power of unions, which may
reduce union influence on labor market regulation policies. Since high-
technology firms and newly established branch plants are resistant to

strength. As an economically disadvantaged region, Southern states were
early architects of industrial recruitment policies in the 1930s. Following
the same logic, they should adopt the new entrepreneurial policies while
simultaneously deregulating labor markets as an industrial recruitment
incentive. Southern Democrats frequently have been probusiness, reflect-
ing a political heritage of weak unions, strong business influences, and
noncompetitive elections. This should lead to support for entrepreneurial
and industrial recruitment policies while, at the same time, Southern Dem-
ocrats should promote the labor market regulation policies of their tra-
ditional labor allies.

Political institutions.—State-centered theorists contend that strong
state capacities provide state managers with the institutional tools for
proactive interventions that expand their control over their institutional
environments (Heclo 1974; Skocpol and Amenta 1986). Constitutional
centralization reduces legislative veto points and increases the likelihood
of proactive intervention. Bureaucratization provides the capacity to ad-
minister large routine programs (such as industrial recruitment and labor
market regulation) as well as the political insulation needed for entre-
preneurial interventions (Katzenstein 1984; Kitschelt 1986).

We examine three state government capacities: (1) the power of gov-
ernor’s offices, (2) administrative capacity, and (3) the professionalism of
state legislatures. Governor’s powers and administrative capacity are in-
dicators of administrative centralization. Over the past few decades, gov-
ernor’s offices have professionalized and developed stronger policy ca-
pacities. Stronger constitutional powers give governors greater ability to
block legislative vetoes and promote proactive policies (Bowman and
Kearney 1986; Dometrius 1999), which should lead to proactive economic
development policies. A second centralized state capacity is the bureauc-
racy. The federal-to-state devolution of social and economic policies has
pushed state governments to develop more rationalized administrations,
making state agencies responsible for administering a wide range of eco-
nomic, social, and environmental programs (Barrilleaux 1999). The
strength of the central administration should facilitate all three economic
development policies. State legislatures are, by comparison, more decen-
tralized institutions with strong ties to special and local constituencies.
More professionalized state-level legislatures mean longer sessions, better
pay, and larger staffs, thereby strengthening policy-development capaci-
ties (Brace and Ward 1999). Some researchers argue that more profes-
sionalized legislatures generate more support for proactive policy. Fine-
gold and Skocpol (1995) found that more professionalized legislatures were
initiators of generous welfare policy during the 1920s and 1930s. But,
given the relatively decentralized structure of legislatures, professionalism
may only strengthen veto points and opposition to proactive policy. We
test both propositions, as indicated in table 2.

Pluralists argue that electoral competition makes elected officials more
responsive to the median voter (Ranney 1976). Converging with class
arguments, increased voter turnout makes middle- and working-class vot-
ers more critical to this median voter constituency (Dye 1979). Studies
have found that both electoral competition and voter turnout contribute
to state government welfare expenditure (Dye 1979; Amenta 1998; Hicks
1999; Amenta and Halfmann 2000). Since proactive economic develop-
ment policies promise to stimulate economic growth, jobs, and employ-
ment protection, electoral competition and voter turnout should promote
the adoption of these policies. It is also possible (as noted above) that
electoral competition conditions the effects of voter turnout, leading us
to test the interaction between electoral competition and voter turnout.

Prior political legacies —Cross-national studies of welfare development
argue that prior policies and accompanying institutions and class mobi-
lization often influence contemporary policies. As discussed above, this
may work in a path-dependent fashion where political legacies largely fix
subsequent policy outcomes directly (Hicks 1999), or prior political leg-
acies may facilitate subsequent class mobilization, institutional develop-
ment, and underlying production regimes that in turn affect policy out-
comes (i.e., a mediation effect [Huber and Stephens 2001]). To examine
the effects of prior political legacies in the U.S. subnational context, we
draw on Amenta and Halfmann (2000), who classify the U.S. state gov-
ernments based on the combination of political actors and institutions
that contributed to progressive welfare policy in the Second New Deal
during the late 1930s. Specifically, we examine whether state governments
that Amenta and Halfmann (2000) define as the “best cases” for welfare
policy development were also innovators in proactive economic devel-
opment policy, and whether this prior political legacy contributes directly
or is mediated in its effect on state development policy by contemporary
class and institutional factors.

Subnational production regimes.—In the cross-national context, pro-
duction regimes are defined by the degree of economic coordination as
opposed to arm’s-length market transactions (Huber and Stephens 2001,
pp. 99-112). In Western Europe, working-class mobilization interacted
with capitalist mobilization and a strong centralized state to create neo-
corporatist bargaining that has facilitated proactive economic intervention
(Katzenstein 1984; Kenworthy 1995) and strong welfare policies (Hicks
1999; Huber and Stephens 2001). In the United States, a weak labor
movement, business dominance, and a tradition of minimal economic
coordination means that federal-level intervention is limited, and intra-
capitalist conflicts are often key to policy development. Nonetheless, Caw-
son (1986) contends that these conditions may also favor direct economic
intervention at the subnational level. In our state-level analysis, we ex-
amine three aspects of the underlying production regime: (1) the economic
dominance of different business sectors, (2) the fiscal dependence of state
government on corporate profits, and (3) mezocorporatist bargaining
potential.

Different sectors of business have a stake in specific development pol-
icies. Large manufacturing corporations benefit from industrial recruit-
ment policies while smaller agricultural and service firms usually fear
higher taxes and wages and may oppose development subsidies for other
business sectors. Large manufacturing corporations typically have their
own R&D programs and are indifferent to entrepreneurial policies that
are more useful to medium and smaller high-technology manufacturing.
Some argue that large manufacturers are central to the political campaign
to deregulate labor markets (Canak and Miller 1990), joining with small
and medium-sized business to lower labor costs. In contrast, others argue
that large corporations benefit from labor market regulations that create
more efficient labor markets, rationalize large multistate operations, and
boost corporate legitimacy (Edwards 1979). We test both propositions.

More advanced high-technology and service sectors depend on new
technology and should facilitate all three development strategies, includ-
ing labor market regulations that attract talented workers and promote
local quality of life. Less advanced industries should be more concerned
about keeping taxes and labor costs low and should oppose both types
of business subsidy as well as labor market regulation.

Private venture capitalists are critical to the organization and effec-
tiveness of regional development (Florida and Kenney 1991; Jenkins,
Leicht, and Jaynes 2006). Some state governments have created public
venture capital programs to compensate for the local lack of private ven-
ture capital (Eisinger 1991). Private venture capitalists may also actively
oppose entrepreneurial policies that compete with their investment activ-
ities but favor industrial recruitment policies that complement their efforts
to attract new industry and investment. Because of their interest in new
business start-ups, venture capitalists should oppose labor market regu-
lations that raise labor costs and conflict with their entrepreneurial
ideology.

The capital-dependence thesis argues that state managers are struc-
turally dependent on private investment for the creation of jobs, tax rev-
enues, and economic growth (Lindblom 1977; Offe 1984; Block 1987).
This dependence is magnified at the subnational level, where the high
geographic mobility of capital forces state and local governments to com-
pete for private investment (Peterson 1995; Grant 1995). Capital depen-
dence should pressure state managers to initiate entrepreneurial policies
independently to create new enterprises, subsidize existing firms with
industrial recruitment, and provide relocation incentives by reducing la-
bor market regulation.

We use two measures of capital dependence: (1) the fiscal dependence
of state governments on corporate income taxes, and (2) deindustriali-
zation, that is, the loss of high-wage manufacturing jobs (Bluestone and
Harrison 1982). Both factors should prompt state officials to initiate en-
trepreneurial and industrial recruitment policies independently and, as a
recruitment tool, to deregulate labor markets.

Neocorporatist theory argues that the three-way combination of cen-
tralized capital/labor representation, strong multiclass mobilization, and
strong state capacities facilitates direct state intervention (Katzenstein
1984; Cawson 1985). The presence of a single encompassing peak asso-
ciation for both capital and labor means that the leaders of these class
sectors are likely to act as classwide representatives who invest in col-
lective goods for their class as a whole. Centralized representation facil-
itates negotiation, the development of interpersonal trust, and discipline
within class sectors. A high level of multiclass mobilization creates a
balance of class power that encourages class representatives to negotiate
positive-sum outcomes, such as investment incentives and employment
programs to promote economic development. At the state government
level, this mobilization is best gauged through business and labor lobby
representation. Strong state capacities are the third leg of the neocorpor-
atist stool, providing the institutional tools for implementing direct in-
tervention policies. This type of neocorporatist combination has been a
major influence on cross-national social spending (Hicks 1999; Huber and
Stephens 2001) and national industrial policies (Katzenstein 1984; Ken-
worthy 1995). Several state-level studies have argued that neocorporatist
capital/labor bargaining nurtured by strong governors and legislative
leaders was important to the adoption of entrepreneurial policies in the
1970s and 1980s (Osborne 1988; Ferguson and Ladd 1988; Eisinger 1988,
pp. 286-89; Jackson 1988; Hill and Negrey 1985; Brace 1993; Bartsch
1985; Brace 1993; Osborne 1988). Gray and Lowery (1990) found that
state-level neocorporatist bargaining contributed to industrial recruitment
policies, and, in earlier work (Jenkins and Leicht 1996; Leicht and Jenkins
1998), we found that neocorporatist bargaining potential contributes to
the adoption of public venture capital programs.

Why should neocorporatist bargaining be relevant at the subnational
level, especially in a decentralized “pluralistic” state such as the United
States? Cawson (1986) argues that decentralized institutions and a weak
labor movement discourage direct federal-level state intervention. But at
the subnational level, favorable institutions and class mobilization make
neocorporatist bargaining and direct intervention an appealing response
to the competition for local investment. In the United States, state gov-
ernments also have a long experience with supply-side economic inter-
vention, providing public higher education and employment services and
administering social-welfare programs. Mezocorporatist institutions
should facilitate both direct and indirect intervention. We operationalize
state-level mezocorporatism as a three-way interaction combining: (1) a
single peak association for both capital and labor, (2) the political mo-
bilization of capital and labor, and (3) strong state capacities.

Controls for federal fiscal constraints.—We also control for changing
federal fiscal constraints that have been linked to state-level development
policies. Eisinger (1988, pp. 67-68) argues that the reduction of federal
transfer payments in this period stimulated the adoption of the new en-
trepreneurial and industrial recruitment policies. Defense spending has
also functioned in the past as a type of regional industrial policy (Hooks
and Bloomquist 1992). Since this period witnessed a major reduction in
defense spending, the loss of federal defense spending may have spurred
states to adopt new entrepreneurial and industrial recruitment policies.
(see Greene 1998, p. 419; 2000, p. 617). Inspection of Durbin-Watson
statistics, additional autoregressive terms (up to the fifth order), and com-
parison of results with three single-equation models using error compo-
nents suggests that this estimation technique produces the best and most
conservative results.

Dependent variables: measuring policy strategies —To gauge these pol-
icy strategies, we use the annual sum of policies adopted by each state
government for each of the three economic development strategies starting
in 1971 and concluding in 1990.° Drawing on prior literature (including
our earlier confirmatory factor analysis [Leicht and Jenkins 1994]), we
classify these programs as entrepreneurial, industrial recruitment, and
labor market regulation (see table 1). The entrepreneurial index is the
annual sum of five programs, the industrial recruitment index is the an-
nual sum of 26 programs, and labor market regulation is the annual sum
of three programs. These measures gauge the adoption of particular strat-
egies as states elect to adopt specific programs out of the total matrix of
policy choices. This method is best for capturing policy adoption and
allows us to gauge the simultaneous adoption of multiple strategies. We
focus on 1971-90 because this is a critical period for the adoption of state-
level economic development policy and is the longest period for which
complete data on all these economic development policies are currently
available.’

Annual measures of specific policies come from the Minnesota De-
partment of Trade and Economic Development report State Technology
Programs in the United States (1988), the National Association of State
Development Agencies’ Directory of Incentives for Business Investment
and Development in the United States (1981, 1986, 1991), Eisinger (1988,
1991), Conway Data’s Site Selection and Industrial Development Hand-
book (1971-90), and our own telephone survey of state government de-
velopment agencies (available from the authors).

Measuring independent variables.—Table 3 provides details on our in-
dependent measures. Several of our measures have been used in previous
studies so we only discuss in detail those that are novel or that require
special justification. All are annualized except as constrained by data
availability as noted in table 3. Class theory points to the importance of
both business and working/middle-class mobilization. Classwide business
Presence of single-business peak association (authors’
phone survey; Morehouse 1981; Thomas and Hre-
benar 1982; mean=.21, SD=.40)

Business lobbyists as % registered lobbyists (Hunter,
Wilson, and Brunk 1991; mean=55.50, SD= 10.78)

% manufacturing workers employed by enterprises
with 1,000+ workers (U.S. Dept. of Commerce
1971-9la; mean=7.96, SD=3.21)

Union density based on membership in manufacturing/
total workers and total union membership/total
workers (U.S. Dept. of Commerce 1971-914; union
density mean = 20.77, SD =8.22)

% state legislature Democratic + margin (win/loss) of
Democratic governor’s candidate in most recent
election (U.S. Dept. of Commerce 1971—91a;
mean =61.53, SD=18.91)

12 states of the Confederacy (mean =.25, SD=.43)
mobilization is gauged by three measures. The first is the presence of a
single-business peak association. Three states have no business peak as-
sociation, and almost half have two or more, a sign of weakened intra-
business unity. We use a dummy variable to represent a single-business
peak association (1) in comparison to states with no or multiple business
peak associations (0). Our second indicator is a measure of business lob-
byists as a percentage of all state lobbyists, which captures the relative
dominance of business among state lobbyists, and the third is a measure
of manufacturing concentration. Manufacturing concentration reduces
free-rider problems and should facilitate business unity. Working-class
strength is gauged by two measures: (1) industrial union density based
on manufacturing union membership as a percentage of manufacturing
jobs, and (2) general union density (i.e., union membership as a percentage
of total state labor force). The first measure taps the strength of the
industrial unions that have been the backbone of progressive unionism,
and the second measure taps the overall strength of the union movement.
To capture the “democratic class struggle,” we use Democratic Party
strength based on the percentage of state legislators who are Democrats
plus the popular voting margin (percentage plus or minus) for the Dem-
ocratic candidate for governor in the most recent statewide election.
Southern states are defined as the 12 states of the former Confederacy
(yes = 1, all other states = 0).

Political institutions include institutional actors with an interest in par-
ticular policies and conditioning and empowering contexts for the intro-
duction of policies. We use the constitutional powers of the governor’s
office to measure governor’s powers because these constitutional powers
represent the centralized resources controlled by governors and their abil-
ity to block legislative vetoes. Administrative capacity is measured by the
mean of the Z-scores for welfare spending per capita and total state rev-
enue per capita. This measures a state’s policy heritage of proactive social
welfare intervention and the total financial resources available to state
government. Legislative professionalism is measured as the mean of the
Z-scores for legislative salaries and the length of legislative sessions. Better
salaries and longer sessions are indicators of greater legislative resources.
Because of the decentralized structure of state legislatures, this measure
taps a decentralized state capacity. Electoral competition is measured by
the Ranney index (1976) which uses the margin of electoral victory in the
most immediate statewide election. Closer margins of victory indicate
greater interparty competition. Voter turnout is measured using the per-
centage of eligible voters who voted in the most recent statewide election.
Empowering and conditioning effects of these institutional conditions on
class mobilization are measured by interaction terms that combine specific
class resources with institutional conditions.

As noted above, we measure prior policy legacies with a dummy var-
iable (yes = 1, no = 0) representing the states that Amenta and Halfmann
(2000, p. 516) identify as the best cases for the adoption of strong welfare
policies in the Second New Deal.* These were strongly democratized states
with strong institutional protections for voting rights, reformed parties,
left or center/left party control, strong administrative capacities, and a
mobilized labor movement. Following the idea of path dependence, these
conditions may have directly facilitated the adoption of state economic
development policies or indirectly worked by producing a political context
that is favorable to later policy innovations.

To capture underlying production regimes, we use three measures of
capitalist sectors: (1) large manufacturing corporations based on the num-
ber of Fortune 500 manufacturing headquarters, (2) advanced industry
as measured by the percentage of the state labor force in the service sector
of the economy,’ and (3) the number of private venture capital corpora-
tions. All three tap the structural and direct influence of specific industrial
sectors with a stake in particular development policies.

The underlying production regime is also reflected in structural con-
straints: (1) fiscal dependence on corporate income taxes, measured by
corporate income taxes as a percentage of total state revenues; (2) dein-
dustrialization, measured as the average annual change in manufacturing
employment as a percentage of total employment (reverse coded so that
states losing the most manufacturing employment receive the highest
scores on this measure); and (3) the potential for mezocorporatist
bargaining.

To measure mezocorporatist bargaining potential, we use a three-way
interaction between: (1) encompassing centralized capital/labor represen-
tation based on the copresence of a single peak association for both capital
and labor (state governments with the copresence of a single peak asso-
ciation for both capital and labor = 1, all others = 0), (2) capital/labor
mobilization based on the density of business and labor lobbyists (i.e.,
business lobbyists + union lobbyists divided by the total state population),
and (3) one of the three state capacity terms—governor’s powers, legis-
lative professionalism, or administrative capacity (as defined above). The
first component compares states with only one encompassing peak as-
sociation for business and one peak association for unions (coded “1”) to
states with no peak association for either business or labor or states with
multiple peak associations for either business or labor (coded “0”).'° The
second component measures business/labor lobbying pressure on state
legislators. Our full model includes the additive effects of the three com-
ponents of the mezocorporatist interaction, the three two-way interactions
between the three measures, and the three-way interaction representing
mezocorporatist bargaining institutions.

We arithmetically center all three measures on their means to reduce
multicollinearity (Aiken and West 1991, pp. 32-35). The mezocorporatist
thesis contends that it is the simultaneous conjuncture of all three factors
that facilitates direct and indirect intervention. The critical question is
whether the three-way mezocorporatism terms are statistically significant
net of all main effects, including all two-way terms (see Jaccard et al.
1990, pp. 40-42; Aiken and West 1991, chap. 2). In view of the long-
running debate over the interpretability of lower-order terms in a three-
way interaction equation (Hays [1963] argues against, Jaccard et al. [1990,
p. 14] and Aiken and West [1991, pp. 32-35] argue for), we do not interpret
these lower-order terms. To corroborate our results, we also test an al-
ternative two-way interaction measure of mezocorporatism, obtaining
similar results which we present below.

Finally, we measure and control for federal fiscal constraints: (1) federal
transfers as a percentage of the state budget (lagged one year), and (2)
total defense spending per capita in each state (lagged one year). Negative
changes in these should spur state managers to adopt new policies to
stimulate private investment.

in parallel so that model 1 in each table includes the control variables
and the political legacy effect on the three strategies, model 2 adds the
class variables, model 3 adds political institutions, and models 4-7 add
the underlying production regime, including mezocorporatism. We or-
ganize this discussion by theory bloc, tracing the effects of various var-
iables across the three policy strategies.

Model 1 shows that reduced federal transfer payments pressured states
to be proactive across all three strategies, supporting Eisinger’s (1988, pp.
87-89) contention that the “new federalism” was an important impetus
to development policy innovation. Significantly, this extends to labor mar-
ket regulation, suggesting this devolution of responsibilities has extended
beyond providing business subsidies to creating more rationalized labor
markets. The political legacy of a best-case scenario for welfare innovation
in the 1930s also contributes to entrepreneurial policy but works against
industrial recruitment and has no effect on labor market regulation policy.
With respect to direct intervention, this indicates significant continuity
across several decades. This same legacy, however, discourages industrial
recruitment policies, which is contrary to our prediction. This suggests
that a high level of democratization, administrative capacity, and strong
unions during this earlier period created a political legacy that discourages
this type of indirect business subsidy. These states favor direct entrepre-
neurial policies to create new high-technology industry but shun indirect
industrial recruitment. Defense spending is never significant in any of
these equations, indicating state governments are not responding signif-
icantly to the loss and regional shifts in defense spending through the
adoption of new economic development policies.

Model 2 adds the class factors, showing that unified business peak
associations promote entrepreneurial and industrial recruitment but dis-
courage labor market regulation policy. These results support the argu-
ment that business unity promotes business subsidies. It also indicates
that single-business peak associations are attempting to balance the in-
terests of various business sectors by working against labor market reg-
ulation. Stronger business lobbies favor all three policies, indicating gen-
eral business support for business subsidies and the perceived benefits of
rationalized labor markets. Greater manufacturing concentration also pro-
motes industrial recruitment and labor market regulation policy, further
reinforcing the conclusion that business unity favors labor market regu-
lation. The discrepancy between the single-business peak association effect
and the two other business unity measures is probably the result of the
political constraints on single-business peak associations that balance the
interests of small and medium-sized business against big business.

Union density is never statistically significant in predicting any of these
policies, including labor market regulation. Tests of the alternative mea-
sure for union density in manufacturing produced similar results. Given
that unions were crucial for promoting labor market regulation prior to
World War II and during the 1950s and 1960s (Jacobs 1978), this suggests
that union decline has blunted the ability of unions to influence state-
level economic policy. Labor regulation policy is also not affected by the
best-case scenario, which was based in part on strong unions in the 1930s.
This suggests significant discontinuity between the strength of the union
movement in the 1930s and our period. While 1930s labor strength may
have been a favorable political legacy for stimulating entrepreneurial pol-
icy, it did not promote sustained political support for labor market reg-
ulation in our period.

As predicted, Democratic Party power discourages entrepreneurial and
industrial recruitment policy, pointing toward a partisan division over
these policies. Republicans favor business subsidies while Democrats gen-
erally oppose these policies. However, Democratic Party power negatively
affects labor market regulation (model 2), suggesting a reversal of tra-
ditional partisan stances toward this issue.'' In the fuller models 4 and
5, a regional split over entrepreneurial policy helps explain this result.
Democratic Party strength in the South positively affects entrepreneurial
as well as labor market regulation policy, appealing to both labor allies
and probusiness conservatism. Northern Democrats are no longer major
players in this contemporary policy battle that is being waged by Southern
Democrats with sufficient power to be influential.

Model 3 controls for political institutions, showing that governor’s pow-
ers affect entrepreneurial and industrial recruitment policies, and that
administrative capacity promotes all three policies. Professionalized leg-
islatures have mixed effects, promoting entrepreneurial policy but limiting
labor market regulation. Electoral competition encourages state govern-
ments to use business subsidies to attract new private investment and to
roll back labor market regulation in a bid to attract new industry. In-
creased voter turnout promotes industrial recruitment and labor market
regulation policy as well. We also tested the interaction between electoral
competition and voter turnout, but the interaction term is not statistically
significant (results not shown but available from the authors). Adding
political institutions eliminates the significance of the single-business peak
associations on entrepreneurial and industrial recruitment policy as well
as the “South” effect on entrepreneurial policy. This suggests that the
business peak association and South effects are the result of broader in-
stitutional differences across the states.
Model 4 adds controls for the underlying production regime, showing
that the presence of advanced industry promotes all three types of inter-
vention. Fiscal dependence on corporate taxes is a key impetus for en-
trepreneurial policy, underscoring the importance of creating new industry
to these state governments. Industrial recruitment policy, in contrast, en-
tails a trade-off in which firms often are granted waivers on taxes that
may discourage state managers from pursuing this option. Deindustrial-
ization prompts state governments to adopt entrepreneurial and industrial
recruitment policies, but it is negatively associated with labor market
regulation policies. This result suggests that manufacturing job loss
spurred state governments to reduce labor market regulation in a bid for
new investment. Private venture capitalists are associated with more in-
dustrial recruitment policy and rollbacks in labor market regulation, both
of which reinforce their business operations.

In these models, the production regime mediates the positive effect of
professional legislatures on entrepreneurial policy and the positive effects
of administrative capacity and voter turnout on labor market regulation
policy. Controlling for the production regime reveals the above-mentioned
effects of manufacturing concentration and Southern Democratic Party
strength on labor market regulation policy. It also reveals a significant
negative effect of electoral competition, suggesting that, contrary to our
prediction, competitive elections actually weaken support for labor market
regulation. This is compatible with the idea that union decline has weak-
ened electoral support for workers’ rights.

Models 5-7 control for mezocorporatism, first using the administrative
capacity measure and then legislative professionalism as components. Be-
cause of multicollinearity, the single-business peak and the business lobby
power measures are removed from these equations.” Both forms of me-
zocorporatism contribute to all three policies. Because of multicollinearity
between the administrative-based mezocorporatism measure and the
Southern Democratic power interaction, the three-way interaction is not
significant in model 5 for entrepreneurial and industrial recruitment pol-
icies. Once the Southern Democratic power interaction is removed (model
6), mezocorporatism significantly affects both policies. We also examined
governor’s powers as a component of mezocorporatism, but this measure
never reached statistical significance.

Graphing mezocorporatism.—To further specify the relationship be-
tween class actors, political institutions, and economic development policy
we examined the effects of state administrative capacity and legislative
professionalism across different values of our measures of peak association
and lobbying activity, the main class-based components of mezocorpo-
ratism. These results are presented in figures 1-5. We center the dependent
variable in these graphs to ease interpretation.

Figures 1-3 examine the effects of different values of administrative
capacity as a measure of political institutions for high (1 SD or greater
above the mean) and low (—1 SD or more below the mean) values of
lobby density and peak association presence. Looking at the results for
entrepreneurial and industrial recruitment policy, the results suggest that
the presence of mobilized class actors for business and labor in the absence
of facilitative political institutions is especially detrimental for the adop-
tion of these economic development policies. In the presence of mobilized
class actors, increases in administrative capacity from one standard de-
viation below (around the twentieth percentile) to one standard deviation
above the mean (around the eightieth percentile) moves entrepreneurial
policy one-half a standard deviation upward. If the range is extended to
the ninetieth percentile of state administrative capacity, the change in
entrepreneurial policy is almost two-thirds of a standard deviation.

In figure 2, the same can be said for the effects of administrative ca-
pacity in the presence of mobilized class actors—mobilized actors in states
with relatively limited administrative capacity have industrial recruitment
policies approximately one-half a standard deviation below the mean.
This value approaches the mean as state administrative capacity reaches
its eightieth percentile value. Taken together, these results suggest that
state administrative capacities have strong conditioning effects on the
adoption of entrepreneurial and industrial recruitment policies and are
especially helpful at channeling the activities of mobilized class actors
toward these policies.

The remaining figures tell a different story regarding the effects of
mezocorporatist bargaining institutions on economic development poli-
cies. In figure 3, state administrative capacities are central to the adoption
of labor regulation policies in contexts with mobilized class actors. The
movement from one standard deviation below the mean on state admin-
istrative capacity to one standard deviation above increases commitment
to labor regulation policies by two-thirds of a standard deviation, and the
predicted commitment to industrial recruitment policy surpasses the com-
mitment by states without mobilized class actors with mean levels of
administrative capacity. This is much the same as the effects of legislative
professionalism on industrial recruitment policies in the mobilized class
actor context (fig. 4). Above the median score for legislative profession-
alism, commitment to industrial recruitment policy moves drastically up-
ward, almost an entire standard deviation. Commitments to industrial
recruitment and labor market regulation policies are dramatically im-
proved by strong political institutions that facilitate and channel the ac-
tivities of mobilized class actors.

Figure 5 examines the effects of different values of legislative profes-
sionalism on labor regulation policy for high and low values of lobby
density and peak association activity. Here, mobilized class actors are an
important facilitator of commitment to labor market regulation policies,
and professionalized legislatures enhance this commitment further. In the
absence of these actors, political institutions have little or no influence on
labor regulation policies.

These figures suggest that the activities of mobilized class actors are
conditioned by state-level political institutions, thereby promoting eco-
nomic development policies. Where these institutions are weaker, class
effects are significantly less. For entrepreneurial policy, political institu-
tions (especially state administrative capacity) have important indepen-
dent effects on policy commitment and play a role in steering mobilized
class actors.

Conditioning effects —To evaluate whether state capacities condition
the effects of class variables on economic development initiatives, we
center our predictors on their means and test a comprehensive set of 90
interactions between the 10 class mobilization/production regime variables
and the three state capacity variables. We add these interactions separately
to model 4, tables 4-6. To save space, tables 7, 8, and 9 present only the
statistically significant interactions along with their main effects. All other
interactions were not statistically significant. Overall, almost one-third
(29) of these interactions are statistically significant, indicating that state
capacities are important contexts for interpreting class effects.

Of the 29 statistically significant interactions, 10 enhance state com-
mitment to specific economic development policies, and 19 reduce these
commitments. The class variables that are the most sensitive to their state
capacity contexts are business lobby power (where six of the nine potential
interaction terms are statistically significant), Democratic vs. Republican
Party power (where five of the nine potential interaction terms are sta-
tistically significant), advanced industry (where five of the nine potential
interaction terms are statistically significant), and manufacturing concen-
tration (where four of the nine potential interaction terms were statistically
significant). All three state capacities modify class effects, but the policy
input institutions (governors and legislatures) produce 23 of the 29 sig-
nificant class-institution interactions.

Looking first at entrepreneurial policy (table 7), 7 of the 30 possible
interactions are statistically significant. The effects of organized business
interests are conditioned by the presence of facilitative state capacities.
Enhanced governor’s powers combines with single-business peak asso-
ciations, Republican Party power, and advanced industry to promote en-
trepreneurial policies. Legislative professionalism combines with business
lobby power, Democratic Party power, and advanced industry to promote
entrepreneurial policies. Only the combination of private venture capital
firms and state administrative capacity reduces state commitments to
entrepreneurial policies.
Unlike the effects of state administrative capacity and class on entre-
preneurial policies, the effects of state administrative capacity reduce com-
mitment to industrial recruitment policies. This is a sign that powerful
business interests are more central to stimulating new entrepreneurial
economic development policies instead of more traditional industrial re-
cruitment policies. Only the interaction between governor’s powers and
large manufacturing corporations and advanced industry, along with the
interaction between state administrative capacity and Democratic Party
power, seem to promote industrial recruitment policies by the states. All
the remaining interactions suggest that mobilized class power serves to
reduce commitment to industrial recruitment policies as state capacity
increases.

Much the same could be said of the combination of state capacities
and class forces in the promotion of labor regulation policies. Only the
governor’s powers x advanced industry interaction promotes commitment
to labor regulation policies. All other interactions, including interactions
with union density and Democratic Party power, reduce state commitment
to these policies.

Overall, these results suggest that state political institutions condition
the effects of class forces on economic development policy. Relatively
strong state capacities are an important context for promoting direct in-
tervention but are relatively less critical for promoting indirect
intervention.

Political legacy effects —Earlier we saw that the best-case variable has
strong direct effects on state economic development policies, indicating
positive and negative path dependence. To further explore this, we ran
the models in tables 4-6 with the best-case variable removed to see if it
also contributes to contemporary factors that are correlated with these
policies (results not shown but available from the authors). Several con-
temporary correlates of industrial recruitment policy emerged as statis-
tically significant, suggesting that they stem from this legacy and, in turn,
contribute to this policy. With the best-case measure removed, manufac-
turing concentration and private venture capital positively and signifi-
cantly affect industrial recruitment policy, which is in line with our earlier
predictions (table 3). Likewise, competitive elections and declining federal
transfers encourage this policy once the best-case measure is removed.
However, removing the best-case measure reveals a significant negative
effect of legislative professionalism, suggesting that relatively profession-
alized legislatures dampen commitments to industrial recruitment policy.
These results reinforce the conclusion that the political conditions giving
rise to early welfare innovation have a strong path-dependence effect on
state economic development policies and, at least for industrial recruit-
ment, also contribute to several contemporary factors that promote and
discourage this policy approach.

Do political legacies create facilitative contexts for the operation of
contemporary factors? To examine this, we test a comprehensive set of
interactions between our best-case measure and all other independent
variables. Tables 10, 11, and 12 show the parallel equations for SUR
models when adding the two-way interactions between the best-case states
and the class mobilization/institutional measures to model 4 in tables 4—
6. To save space, we present only the main effects and the interaction
terms.

The best-case welfare policy legacy positively affects entrepreneurial
policy in interaction with single-business peak associations, manufactur-
ing concentration, and enhanced governor’s powers. The effects of busi-
ness lobby power, electoral competition, and advanced industry are neg-
ative in the presence of this policy legacy. This same general pattern of
results is found in the analysis of industrial recruitment policies (table
11). The real differences come in the analysis of labor market regulation
policies, where business lobby power and advanced industry (the same
factors that reduced commitment to entrepreneurial and industrial re-
cruitment policies in the best-case states context) increase commitments
to labor regulation policies. This suggests that states that can produce
progressive welfare provisions are also capable of taking mobilized busi-
ness actors and promoting labor market regulation policies.

Robustness checks.—We checked these results through several methods.
Because multicollinearity might bias our three-way interaction results for
mezocorporatism, we constructed an alternative measure using a simpli-
fied two-way interaction between business and union peak associations
and lobby density and our measures of state capacities presented earlier.
This simplified measure is constructed by multiplying the joint business/
union peak dummy variable by business/union lobby density and then

using this term to construct a two-way interaction with all three state
capacities. Table 13 presents only the main effects and two-way inter-
actions for this alternative mezocorporatism measure. The results are
essentially unchanged from those in tables 4-6 with the only difference
being that administrative mezocorporatism does not predict entrepreneu-
rial policy but legislative mezocorporatism does. The two-way interaction
with governor’s powers is never significant (not shown but available from
the authors). This reinforces the conclusion that mezocorporatist bar-
gaining potential contributes to these three state economic development
policies.

We further tested our results using three independent GLS equations
in an error-components model with an AR1 term, obtaining similar results
to those reported above. We also tested for two-to-five year lags for dein-
dustrialization, governor’s powers, administrative capacity, legislative
professionalism, federal transfer payments, and defense spending, finding
that a one-year lag creates the strongest statistically significant coefficients.

A final set of tests focused on the temporal consistency of these results.
One test split the sample into two decades, producing slightly stronger
coefficients for 1981-90. This reflects the fact that most of the change in
this policy measure occurred during the second decade of our study period.
Introducing a yearly count measure (i.e., 1971 = 1, 1972 = 2, 1973 =
3, and so on) produced multicollinearity between the year measure and
all three proximity measures, indicating the existence of a ratchetlike
process in policy adoption. New policies are added in part through the
imitation of neighboring states and rarely rescinded. Our geographic prox-
imity control captures this ratchet effect. Inspection of the LaGrange
multiplier indicated no major temporal differences in residuals, and tests
for higher-order autocorrelation (up to ARS) revealed no significant au-
tocorrelation beyond our first-order correction. In summary, our results
appear to be robust.

The decentralized “pluralistic” structure of the U.S. state and the weak-
ness of organized labor mean that direct economic development inter-
vention is unlikely to occur at the national level. Similar industrial policies
were adopted at the national level in post-World War II Western Europe
where centralized states, strong union movements, and centralized peak
association bargaining between capital and labor had developed (Katz-
enstein 1984; Kenworthy 1995). These policies have proven their value
in terms of economic performance, reducing the trade-off between proac-
tive economic policy and generous social policy. In contrast, the U.S.
federal government has followed a neoliberal policy course. This dictates
a conducive stance toward subsidies for private investment while im-
posing relatively stringent social policies. How is this related to subna-
tional development policy? In line with neocorporatist theory (Cawson
1985, 1986), where corporatist institutions exist at the subnational level,
state governments have been more likely to adopt proactive policies to
create high-technology development and to recruit and retain existing
enterprises by providing financial and tax incentives as well as by ra-
tionalizing labor markets.

Is the United States that exceptional with respect to these policies? The
pressures of economic globalization and regional economic integration
appear to be creating a similar devolution in Western Europe (Manor
1999; Bennett 1991) as well as in several developing countries (Burki,
Perry, and Dillinger 1999; Evans 1995), suggesting that the U.S. state may
not be that exceptional. Globalization and the growing systemic power
of capital may be encouraging more centralized states toward a similar
devolution of economic policy. In any case, the federal structure of the
U.S. state and the weakness of organized labor make this political system
especially vulnerable to the economic pressures of footloose investors who
have a high degree of geographic mobility and an entire world for their
investments. This environment, when combined with subnational policies
designed to cater to the interests of mobile investors, can exacerbate re-
gional inequalities and contribute to a growing polarization of regions
within nation-states in the global economy.

In our analysis of state economic development policies, we found ex-
tensive support for all four mechanisms for specifying the joint effects
between mobilized class actors and local political institutions. Regarding
the first mechanism—the independent effects of state institutions and
mobilized class actors—subnational economic development policy reflects
four major sets of variables: (1) the mobilization of particular classes and
class factions that pressure policy makers to adopt specific measures, (2)
the institutional interests and capacities for implementing specific policies,
(3) political legacies, and (4) the structural constraints of underlying pro-
duction regimes. In all our results, we found that class forces and political
institutions independently affect economic development policy.

Regarding the second mechanism, political institutions mediate rela-
tionships between mobilized classes or production regimes and policy
adoption. Political institutions mediate the effects of single-business peak
associations on entrepreneurial and industrial recruitment policies. South-
ern states adopt entrepreneurial policies because of institutional differ-
ences. Underlying production regimes mediate the effects of legislative
professionalism, administrative capacities, and voter turnout on economic
development policy. This suggests that political institutions are embedded
in production regimes that enhance or retard policy development.

Third, institutions condition the effects of class mobilization. We found
several instances where institutions (including political legacies) channeled
the effects of policy adoption in specific directions both toward and away
from commitments to specific policies. Mezocorporatism should be un-
derstood as this type of conditioning effect. Central administrative ca-
pacities and professionalized legislatures condition the impact of mezo-
corporatist mobilized class actors. Where institutions favoring centralized
business/union bargaining exist and business and unions are highly mo-
bilized, these state capacities positively condition the effects of business/
union political mobilization on proactive development policy. In general,
strong political institutions combine interactively with business power to
facilitate direct intervention while relatively weak political institutions
facilitate positive effects of business power on indirect intervention. All
three state capacities—governor’s powers, administrative capacities, and
legislative professionalism—condition the effects of mobilized class actors
on economic development policy.

State-centered theorists have sometimes written as if strong state man-
agers invariably promote state intervention. This depends, however, on
the structure of the institution. Relative to governors and central admin-
istrations, state legislatures are relatively decentralized institutions with
strong ties to local constituencies where small and medium-sized firms
are central. Legislatures also provide opportunities to veto legislation.
Hence, strong legislatures often interactively combine with business power
to block these policies. In general, states with strong governors and state
bureaucracies favor proactive intervention while professionalized legis-
latures are more complex, favoring entrepreneurial and industrial re-
cruitment but opposing labor market regulation policy.

The fourth mechanism involves political legacy effects. Prior welfare
innovations adopted during the 1930s Second New Deal contribute di-
rectly to entrepreneurial policy over three decades later. This legacy also
negatively affects industrial recruitment and labor market regulation pol-
icies, demonstrating path dependence on these earlier policies.

The central class factor in promoting state-level economic development
policy is business mobilization. Although entrepreneurial intervention
could be seen as an ideological threat to the autonomy of private entre-
preneurs, this approach enjoys general business support. Although busi-
ness leaders may often voice support for laissez faire, in practice they
strongly favor public subsidies for private investment, even if these ben-
efits flow to particular entrepreneurs (Stiglitz 2003). While these subsidies
may eventually create higher taxes and labor costs, these are discounted
future costs that are less tangible than immediate business subsidies. Busi-
ness political leaders can present these subsidies to the business com-
munity as collective goods earned by political lobbying and other efforts
to influence state-level policy.

Our major programmatic recommendation is that political sociology
should more intensively examine subnational governmental units as
unique arenas where classes mobilize around peak associations, and gov-
ernmental institutions have the ability to engage in innovative policy
experiments that may or may not “trickle up” to the federal level. This
occurs in a globalizing context where local elites and citizens are pro-
moting local policy innovations designed to improve local competitive
advantage and to advance the welfare of local citizens. Whether this leads
to a “race to the bottom” or to a “race to the top” needs further investi-
gation. We suspect there are trade-offs between proactive development
policy and social policy. But it is important to note that we found a positive
relationship between social welfare spending and proactive development
policies. It is possible that there is a positive-sum return from these de-
velopment policies, similar to that from the industrial policies in Western
Europe and the developing world during the 1960s and 1970s. To better
address these issues, researchers need to pay attention to the ways that
mobilized class action is conditioned by political institutions that promote,
deflect, and channel class interests in specific policy directions.
