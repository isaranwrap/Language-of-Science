In a review which Stark (1979) de-
scribes as a ‘‘definitive work,”’ Tittle et al.
(1978) argue that the class-crime relation-
ship so central to theory in the sociology
of deviance is, in fact, ‘‘myth.’’ A sub-
sequent contribution (Hindelang et al.,
1979) also seems to begin by supporting
this conclusion, referring to Tittle et al.
(1978) as an ‘‘apparently definitive
paper.”’

Hindelang et al. (1979) however, go on
to a sophisticated assessment of the sup-
posed discrepancy between studies on of-
ficial statistics which show a strong nega-
tive association between class and crime,
and self-report studies which show no re-
lationship. Their conclusion is that, in
those few studies which permit the calcu-
lation of levels of association between
class and comparable types of crime on
official versus self-reported measures,
such associations tend to be similarly
negative and similarly weak under the two
measures. The problem is that rarely is it
possible to get self-report data on a set of
offenses of seriousness comparable to the
index offense rates available from official
sources. Given the small sample size and
one-year reference period for the typical
self-report study, to pick up class dif-
ferences would require sensitivity to
events with a ‘‘prevalence rate of 2 or 3
percent’’ in the general adolescent popu-
lation (Hindelang et al., 1979). They
argue that sample sizes of the order of
those employed in the Census Bureau
victimization surveys (over 130,000) are
necessary. The conclusion seems jus-
tified, given, as Hindelang et al. point out,
that there is plentiful evidence that seri-
ousness affects self-report results (cf.
Clark and Wenninger, 1962; Gold, 1970;
Braithwaite and Law, 1978).

The subsequent publication of Elliott
and Ageton’s (1980) first National Youth
Survey marks one of the first serious at-
tempts to.test the class-crime relationship
on a self-report item set which covers
most Part I and Part II UCR offense types.
Even though the sample (1,726) falls far
short of the size suggested by Hindelang
et al., substantial class differences
emerged for the serious crimes against
persons and property but not for victim-
less crimes. On the ‘predatory crimes
against persons’’ subscale, lower class re-
spondents reported nearly four times as
many offenses as middle class respon-
dents, while on the ‘‘predatory crimes
against property’’ subscale the frequency
of offenses was almost twice as high.
There were no class differences on the
other subscales: illegal service crimes,
public disorder, hard drug use, and status
offenses.

A Review of Evidence on the Class-Crime
Relationship
tation) in the literature to ‘many studies,’
we are able to find only 16 investigations
that used official police contact or court
delinquency figures and only seven
studies examining official arrest or con-
viction data for adults’’ (Tittle et al., 1978:
645). After combining these with a number
of self-report studies, the authors included
a total of 35 works in their secondary
analysis. If this is all that could be found,
then they did not look very hard. The pres-
ent review (an expansion of the
Braithwaite [1979] review) includes 53 of-
ficial records and 47 self-report studies on
the relationship between social class and
juvenile crime, and 46 official records
studies of social class and adult crime. In
addition, 57 official records studies on the
relationship between social class of the
area in which individuals live and juvenile
crime were reviewed, and eight self-report
studies on that relationship; as well as 13
official records studies on social class of
area and adult crime.

In my earlier review, other studies of an
ecological nature are discussed. These
show that one is more likely to be the
victim of certain types of crime in a lower
class than in a middle class neighborhood.
Tittle et al. (1978) believe that such studies
are not relevant. The ecological fallacy
notwithstanding, it is hardly plausible that
one can totally explain away the higher
risks of being mugged and raped in lower
class areas as a consequence of the activi-
ties of middle class people who come into
the area to perpetrate such acts. Perhaps
Tittle et al. take their own findings seri-
ously and adopt no extra precautions
when moving about in the slums of the
world’s great cities than they do when
walking in the middle class areas of such
cities. Nevertheless, studies of the class
composition of the areas in which offenses
occur have been excluded from the pres-
ent review.
tinuum (sometimes referred to as the
lower class, sometimes as the working
class, sometimes as the low socioeco-
nomic status group) are those who have
unskilled or semiskilled occupations, or, in
some cases, are the unemployed. In the
case of juveniles, the operationalization of
social class is almost always based on par-
ents’ occupations. Thus, studies based on
disparate definitions of class are compa-
rable at the operationalized level.!

The social class of an area is most fre-
quently operationalized as the percentage
of the adult male population of the area
who are in lower class occupations, the
percentage unemployed, the percentage
on welfare, the percentage below some
poverty line, or some combination of
these. It is also common for composite
indices of the social class of area to in-
clude variables such as the proportion of
houses which are substandard, or of
below-average value, and the proportion
of the population which has a below-
average educational attainment. Social
class of area is a highly robust and empiri-
cally meaningful construct. In numerous
factorial ecologies of cities throughout the
world, social class of area has consistently
emerged as a stable underlying factor
(Timms, 1971), and in most of these
studies social class of area has accounted
for more of the variance than any other
factor in the ecology of the city.
Moreover, Sweetster (1965) and Schmid
and Tagashira (1964) have shown that the
emergence of a factor representing social
class of area is invariant under substitu-
tion of measures.

The definition of crime is more prob-
lematic. For the purposes of this review,
crime is defined as behavior punishable,
but not necessarily punished, under a spe-
cific legal prohibition. Offenses which do
not involve injury to persons other than
Tables 1—4 present the results of studies of
the class-crime relationship based on offi-
cial records of crime separately for social
class and social class of the area in which
the offender lives, and separately for ju-
venile and adult crime. The review in Ta-
bles 1-4 is, no doubt, incomplete. In par-
ticular, there is little mention of the work
on the class-crime relationship carried out
in developing countries. This has already
been covered in an excellent review by
Clinard and Abbott (1973) of studies from
Manila, Kuala Lumpur, Bombay, Kan-
pur, Lucknow, Kampala, Lima, Mexico
City, Caracas, and Puerto Rico. These
studies seem to show unanimously that
lower class people and people from lower
class areas appear in disproportionately
large numbers in the official records of
crime and delinquency in these countries.
Of the 53 studies of class and juvenile
crime which have been reviewed here, 44
showed lower class juveniles to have sub-
stantially higher offense rates than middle
class juveniles. Among adults, all 46
studies found lower class people to have
higher crime rates. Juveniles who lived in
lower class areas were found to have
higher juvenile crime rates in all 57
studies; for adults this was the case in all
13 studies. Thus it has been demonstrated,
with a degree of consistency which is un-
usual in social science, that lower class
people, and people living in lower class
areas, have higher official crime rates than
other groups. .

Table 5 reviews studies on the relation-
ship between self-reported juvenile crime
and class, while Table 6 provides a sum-
mary of findings on the relationship be-
tween self-reported juvenile crime and the
social class of the area in which respon-
dents live. There has been only one self-
report study of adult crime which has in-
vestigated the question of class distribu-
tion. On a sample of American adults,
Tittle and Villemez (1977) found, after
controlling for race, no evidence for a
negative correlation between class and the
self-reporting of theft, gambling, cheating
on tax, assault, and marijuana use. With
the exception of the male reporting of
cheating on tax, the Tittle and Villemez
data do show that nonwhites (male and
female) reported higher levels of involve-
ment than whites. In Tables 5 and 6,
studies which find the lower class to admit
to more delinquency, but where this dif-
ference is not statistically significant, are
recorded as ‘‘No’’ (lower class juveniles
not more criminal).?

Of the 47 self-report studies reviewed in
Table 5, 18 found lower class adolescents
to report significantly higher levels of in-
volvement in delinquent behavior than
middle class youth. Seven studies
provided qualified support for this hy-
pothesis, and 22 found no significant dif-
ferences in reported delinquent involve-
ment among classes. While a greater pro-
portion of the studies have found a signifi-
cant difference than would be expected on
the basis of chance, the fact that almost
half of the studies have failed to uncover a
Statistically significant difference must
leave serious doubt about the relationship.

The review of research on the question
of whether adolescents living in lower
class areas report more delinquency than
those living in middle class areas (Table 6)
also yields mixed support for the class-
crime relationship. Four studies sup-
ported the hypothesis, one provided qual-
ified support, and three found no signifi-
cant difference. One other self-report
study by Pine (1965) has not been included
in this review so far because it could not
be placed into either Table 5 or Table 6. In

work of Nye et al. (1958) has been crit-
icized for internal inconsistency (Hirschi
and Selvin, 1967:108-9; Hirschi, 1969),
and Gold’s (1963:5—7) recomputation of
the published data leads him to conclude
that the data do support the class-juvenile
delinquency relationship anyway. The in-
appropriate use of Guttman scaling in this
study (Braithwaite and Law, 1978) has re-
sulted in a requirement of boys to admit to
either drinking or to drinking and hetero-
sexual relationships in order to get into the
most delinquent category. Both of these
“‘offenses’’ are treated as more serious
than ‘‘stealing a car.’’ The study by Akers
(1964) is probably also best dismissed be-
cause the small number of items are domi-
nated by crimes without victims and very
petty forms of delinquency. McDonald
(1968: 136-42) also points out that the
significance test in the Akers study is
based on a sample with only 13 cases in
the lowest (unskilled) category.

Hirschi (1969:70-5) has argued that an
underrepresentation of the very lowest in
the social class continuum has been a
fundamental weakness of self-report
studies. ‘‘The class model implicit in most
theories of delinquency is a peculiarly
top-heavy, two-class model made up of
the overwhelming majority of respectable
people on the one hand and the lumpen-
proletariat on the other’’ (Hirschi, 1969:
71). Hirschi’s data support the efficacy of
such a model. Between father’s occupa-
tion and self-reported delinquency he
finds only ‘‘a very small relation that
could easily be upset by random distur-
bances of sampling or definition’’ (p. 69).
However, when he looks at the very low-
est on the social class continuum (the
‘‘lumpenproletariat’’), he finds a clear as-
sociation. ‘‘Boys whose fathers have been
unemployed and/or whose families are on
welfare are more likely than children from
fully employed, self-sufficient families to
commit delinquent acts’’ (p. 72). Simi-
larly, Elliott and Ageton’s (1980) signifi-
cant overall relationship between class
and self-reported delinquency is totally a
consequence of the difference in delin-
quency between the lower class group and
the rest of the sample, there being no dif-
ference between the working class and
middle class groups. Spady (1972) has also
shown with official records that, as the
bottom cutting point is moved toward the
lower end of the social class distribution,
the obtained association between social
class and delinquency tends to be
strengthened.

In common with most other self-report
studies, Hirschi (1969) included items
such as ‘‘Have you ever taken little things
(worth less than $2) that did not belong to
you?’’ and ‘‘Have you ever banged up
something that did not belong to you on
purpose?”’ It has been pointed out that the
angry school child who takes another stu-
dent’s pencil and breaks it is guilty of both
of these offenses. In Hirschi’s study a
child who admits to both of these offenses

class and the more serious self-report delinquency items, even in the latter areas.

© This is a longitudinal study in which the relationship between class and crime is examined at two time
periods—junior and senior high school. For neither time period were the Nye-Short items classified as
nonserious significantly related to social class. Serious delinquency was significantly associated with social
class at the junior high school level, but not at the senior high school level.

4 This study is based on an unusual nonrandom sample of 50 high-school boys, 30 boys with one court
appearance, 50 boys on probation and 50 incarcerated offenders. Three subscales, ‘*general theft,” ‘*serious
theft,” and ‘‘common delinquency’’ showed correlations of —.20, —.17 and —.17 respectively with social
class. But when these results were broken down into more detail, the correlations were due to middle and
lower status respondents reporting more delinquency than those in the upper status category, while there
were no differences between middle and lower status boys.

* “Yes” for females, *‘No”’ for males. A number of items in this study represent crimes without victims.

' This study is based on an unusual nonrandom sample. The sample consisted of 100 incarcerated offenders,
136 ‘*Provo Experiment” offenders, and 100 youths who were officially nondelinquent.

‘ Lower class youth did not admit to committing a greater number of different offenses. However, they
admitted to committing most offenses with greater frequency than middle class youth.

4 The independent variable here is “family background” rather than social class as such. **Family back-
ground”’ is indexed by the number of middle class, school-relevant objects in the home (telephone, diction-
ary, encyclopedia, etc.) and the nature of the psychological relationship between parent and child, particu-
larly with regard to school expectations. That is, the independent variable purports to be an index of the
existence of a middle class ethos in the family situation.

4 Allen and Sandhu seem to misinterpret their data at one point in their paper as showing that adolescents
from high income families are more delinquent than those from low income families. Why they do this is
puzzling. From Table 2, p. 265, it is quite clear that while 46% of those in the low family income category are
high on self-reported delinquency, only 37% of those in the higher income category are high on self-reported

delinquency.
to provide statistically significant support
for the class-crime association. The failure
of both of these works to show a signifi-
cant relationship largely reflects the fact
that there were no class differences be-
tween those who admitted to no offense
and those who admitted to only one of-
fense.*

Similarly, Elliott and Ageton (1980)
found that their significant class dif-
ferences disappeared when the propor-
tions of those who reported more than one
offense were compared with those who
reported none. At the other end of the
frequency continuum, Elliott and Ageton
found that class differences were in con-
siderable measure a reflection of a large
number of delinquent offenses reported by
a small number of lower class respon-
dents. When their data were rescored to
truncate the frequency range by making
‘‘3 or more offenses’’ the upper category,
most class differences disappeared. Using
a ‘*3 or more offenses’ upper category is
precisely what has been done in a number
of self-report studies (e.g., Hirschi, 1969;
Williams and Gold, 1972; Elliott and Voss,
1974; Braithwaite, 1979).
Gold (1963:4-7) has pointed out that
many of the offenses in the original Nye,
Short, and Olson (1958) scale (the scale
which most subsequent researchers have
adopted or modified) are not really vio-
lations of the law. ‘‘Disobeyed your par-
ents,’’ ‘‘had a fist fight with another per-
son,’’ ‘‘told a lie,’ ‘‘ran away from
home”? and ‘‘defied your parents’ au-
thority’ are not forms of misbehavior
specifically proscribed as punishable by
law. Clark and Wenninger (1962:833),
after having found no class differences in
the reporting of so-called ‘‘nuisance of-
fenses,”’ but clear class differences on the
more serious offenses, concluded that
supports the class-delinquency relation-
ship, should also be ignored because of
the inclusion of items on drinking,
truancy, and parental defiance, which ac-
count for most of the variation of scores
on the delinquency measure.

The majority of the studies labelled
‘‘No”’ in Table 5 report a very slight (non-
significant) tendency for the lower class to
admit to more delinquency. Bytheway
(1975) has demonstrated the importance of
these slight trends by pooling the data
from three studies often cited as evidence
against the class-delinquency association.
The increased sample size, through pool-
ing the data from the Nye et al. (1958),
Akers (1964), and Hirschi (1969) studies,
results in a statistically significant tend-
ency for the children from low occupa-
tional status families in the three studies to
report more delinquent involvement.

The studies by Erickson (1973) and
Williams and Gold (1972), which found
no class differences in self-reported delin-
quency, must also be considered carefully
because both failed to find class dif-
ferences in officially recorded delin-
quency on their samples. Since a finding
of no class differences in officially re-
corded delinquency is unusual, it may be
that sampling error has resulted in rather
atypical delinquents being included in
these samples. Hindelang et al.’s (1979)
reanalysis of Nye et al. (1958) suggests
that this could be true of the latter as well.

In short, the findings of seven studies
can be questioned—six of them find no
significant relationship between class and
crime (the studies by Akers (1964), Dent-
ler and Monroe (1961), Erickson (1963),
Nye et al. (1958), Vaz (1966), Voss (1966),
and Williams and Gold (1972)). If these
studies are ignored, there remain, in Table
5, 17 studies which support the hypothe-
sis, 7 which partially support it, and 16
which find no significant difference. If
studies based on rural or small town sam-
ples were also excluded, the ratio of sig-
nificant to nonsignificant findings would
increase further. The number of studies
which have uncovered a significant re-
lationship is clearly greater than would be
expected on the basis of chance. It is pos-
sible that the failure to find significance in
a large number of studies is the result of
Certainly the limited class biases un-
covered by studies such as those cited by
Hindelang et al. are insufficient to account
for the strong class-crime relationship
from official records studies. The evi-
dence supports the conclusion that while
class bias might be a profound problem in
some jurisdictions, for many courts and
police departments this bias may be mini-
mal or nonexistent. Therefore the finding
that the records of virtually all courts and
police departments show the lower class
as committing more crime cannot be ex-
plained away by the existence of monu-
mental class bias in all of these statistics.

An interesting question for the sociol-
ogy of sociology is why the early self-
report findings did not also provoke a re-
search interest in the possible class biases
of self-report measures of criminality.
Perhaps the irony is that both liberals and
conservatives found the rejection of the
class-crime relationship too comfortable a
position to challenge. Liberals often suffer
from a magnanimous disinclination to be-
lieve that the lower classes are in any way
nastier than middle class people, while
enjoying any opportunity of construing
the police and courts as illiberal perse-
cutors of the downtrodden. Conservatives
also find it comfortable to deny that class
position is a predictor of criminality be-
cause it enables them to argue that
transforming the class structure is not rel-
evant to solving the crime problem.

In fact there is scattered evidence that
the self-report methodology tends to
exaggerate the proportion of delinquency
perpetrated by the middle class
(Braithwaite, 1979:54-8). For example,
while we know that lower class youth are
more likely than middle class youth to get
into trouble with the police and the courts,
a number of studies have shown that,
when interviewed, lower class youth do
not report that they have been in trouble
with the police or courts more frequently
than do middle class respondents (Hardt,
1968; Carter, 1974; Smith, 1975;
Braithwaite and Braithwaite, 1978). Simi-
larly, lower class youths tend to score
higher on ‘‘lie’’ scales within self-report
measures (Hardt and Peterson-Hardt,
1977; Braithwaite, 1979:56-7). Perhaps
when confronted by unfamiliar white mid-
dle class researchers with their probing
questions, lower class respondents are
more suspicious and defensive than their
middle class counterparts.
point which must be emphasized is that
even the highly selective secondary
analysis of Tittle et al. does not demon-
strate ‘‘the myth of social class and crimi-
nality’’ as their title would have us be-
lieve, but rather a weak inverse relation-
ship between class and crime represented
by an average gamma from the 35 studies
of —.09. Because social science is by de-
sign more concerned about falsely ac-
cepting hypotheses than with falsely ac-
cepting the null hypothesis, it is not well
equipped for demonstrating ‘‘myths.”’

Tittle et al. (1978) fail to establish an
operating definition of what constitutes
crime for the purpose of including studies
in their sample. Hence we have self-
reported adult tax evasion from one of
their own studies (Tittle and Villemez,
1977) lumped together with studies which
use a variety of indices of delinquency.
The problematic of what constitutes delin-
quency is of no concern to the authors.
For example, a study by Stinchcombe
(1964) is included which measures school
misbehavior (e.g., being sent from the
classroom by the teacher). The hypothesis
that middle class children are no less
likely to misbehave in school than lower
class children is quite different from the
hypothesis that middle class people are no
less likely to violate the criminal law than
lower class people.

The most crucial definitional problem
which has been left in abeyance is whether
‘‘white collar’? offenses are to be in-
cluded. A few studies on trade practice
offenders, consumer fraud, or industrial
safety prosecutions could completely
transform a review of studies focusing on
the directly interpersonal types of crime
which are the predominant concern of
police departments. The nature of the
class distribution of crime depends en-
tirely on what form of crime one is talking
about.

The Won and Yamamoto (1968) study
included in the Tittle et al. (1978) review is
excluded from the present review. Won
and Yamamoto investigated 493 cases of
shoplifting apprehended by a security firm
for a chain of supermarkets in Honolulu.
It was found that the shoplifters came dis-
proprotionately from middle class sub-
urbs. Unfortunately, Won and Yamamoto
do not report whether the stores were lo-
cated predominantly in middle class or
lower class areas. Tittle et al. agree that
this and the Stinchcombe (1964) work
criticized earlier, which is also excluded
from the present review, are ‘‘crude’’ and
“‘primitive.””

Tests of statistical significance have
been calculated to support the potency of
the trends discerned by Tittle and his col-
laborators. Their sample of studies is not
random, but a manifestation of a most
biased form of selectivity.> Equally im-
portant from a statistical point of view, the
observations are not independent. A total
of 363 gammas have been gleaned from 35
studies. For any one study, different
gammas for the sample broken down by
age, sex, race, place of residence, and the
like are each treated as a separate obser-
vation. Clearly the gamma for whites sep-
arately would not have been independent
of the gamma for the total of all races, or
the gamma for blacks would not have been
independent of the gamma for people liv-
ing in lower class areas.

Tittle et al. (1978) were thus able to
extract a large number of gammas from a
small number of studies. Given that the
great majority of empirical studies on the
class-crime relationship are of official rec-
ords, it is telling evidence of the unex-
plained selectivity of their review that 302
of the 363 gammas are from self-report
studies. While the mean gamma for the
small number of official records studies
included was —.25, for the self-report
studies, it was a meager —.06.

The conclusion of the Tittle et al. re-
view that ‘‘there has been a monotonic
decline in association between social class
and crime/delinquency’’ (Tittle et al.,
1978:654) is also a function of the selec-
‘‘Social scientists long have assumed an
intimate linkage between a variety of so-
cial pathologies and injustice or inequality
in the distribution of societal resources.”
This opening sentence of the Tittle et al.
(1978) paper creates the impression that
what is to follow is a review of the kinds of
evidence most central to the question of
whether a more equal society would be a
society in which there would be less ‘‘so-
cial pathology.’’ Evidence on whether
lower class people violate the law more
than do middle class people is not the
most crucial kind of evidence to the
equality and crime question. It may be
that conditions of greater inequality in a
society foster greater criminality not only
among the poor but also among the rich.
This is hardly an original idea, having
been developed by Bonger (1916) at the
beginning of the century. Bonger argued
that, first, a criminal attitude is engen-
dered by the conditions of misery inflicted
upon many of the proletariat under
capitalism; and, second, that a similar
criminal attitude among the bourgeoisie
arises from the avarice fostered when
capitalism thrives.

The most relevant empirical test is,
therefore, to ascertain whether inequality
is associated with higher or lower aggre-
gate crime rates. To this end, in my earlier
review I used a number of inequality in-
dices to predict average crime rates on
Uniform Crime Report Indices for the
years 1967 to 1973 in 193 United States
cities. The income gap between the poor
and the average income earner was shown
to be a significant predictor of crime rates,
while the proportion of the population
below the poverty line in the city was not.
A considerable number of other intercity
and international comparisons which are
consistent with this interpretation were
also reviewed.
The most important empirical test of all
will ultimately be time-series investiga-
tions. At this point, however, few time-
series studies have been published which
are both methodologically sound and test
out the effect of clearly conceived indices
of inequality.°

Even on the more limited question of
whether the lower class violate the law
more than the middle class, the kind of
data reviewed by Tittle et al. (1978) is not
the only kind available. The most impor-
tant type of evidence which has been ig-
nored is victimization survey data.
Victimization surveys avoid many of the
class biases possible in both official rec-
ords and self-reports. Hindelang (1978),
for example, has used the National Crime
Panel data to show that whereas only 11%
of the American population are black (and
race is certainly a strong correlate of
class), 39% of rape victims in the survey
reported their assailant to be black. Police
figures record the percentage of rapists
who are black as 48%. The victimization
data therefore show that official statistics
probably exaggerate the proportion of
rapes committed by blacks, but that it is
still probably the case that the rape rate is
several times higher among black than
among white men. Hindelang (1978) also
shows that 62% of robbery, 30% of aggra-
vated assault and 29% of simple assault
victims reported their assailant to be
black.

Another important type of study which
does not fall within the official records or
self-report framework of the present re-
view is the direct observational study.
Systematic observational data on the class
distribution of crime is scarce in the lit-
erature. One could perhaps point to Short
and Strodtbeck’s (1965) study in which
lower class youth were observed to be
Direct observational studies of the class
distribution of crime are rare because it is
logistically very difficult to mount a re-
search effort which systematically ob-
serves enough crime to calculate rates for
different groups. Yet direct observation
clearly is the best source of data because it
is the very second hand and third hand
nature of self-report and official record
compilation which permits bias to enter
into measures.

The conclusion is therefore inescapable
from the voluminous, though not always
satisfactory, evidence available at this
time that lower class people do commit
those direct interpersonal types of crime
which are normally handled by the police
at a higher rate than middle class people.
If, however, we are talking about those
less directly interpersonal forms of crime
which involve the abuse of the power in-
herent in occupational roles (and which
are normally policed by special regulators
of commerce), then, of course, the reverse
is true. The sociological study of crime
does not need ‘‘to shift away from class-
based theories’’ as Tittle et al. (1978) an-
nounce in their concluding sentence.
What we require are class-based theories
which explain why certain types of crime
are perpetrated disproportionately by the
powerless, while other forms of crime are
almost exclusively the prerogative of the
powerful.
Stark convincingly argues that if we assign
adolescents a class position of their own
derived from their location on the success
ladder of the school, then a powerful
class-crime relationship can be demon-
strated. The weight of empirical evidence
that school failure is a strong correlate of
delinquency is beyond question (Sul-
lenger, 1936; Kvaraceus, 1945; Toby and
Toby, 1957; Gold, 1963:44; Lunden, 1964;
Polk, 1965; Polk and Halferty, 1966;
Schafer and Polk, 1967; Rhodes and
Reiss, 1969; Fisher, 1970; Lanphier and
Faulkner, 1970; Burns, 1971; Empey et
al., 1971; Kelly, 1971; Kelly and Balch,
1971; Farrington, 1973; Frease, 1973;
Gold and Mann, 1973; Magishima and
Matsumoto, 1973; Hassall, 1974; Phillips,
1974; Offord et al., 1978).

The idea that much middle class delin-
quency can be explained by the anticipa-
tion of economic failure among middle
class adolescents who are doing badly at
school has also been developed by Hirschi
(1972).
futures of adolescents, rather than their
social class origins, which are most crit-
ical to delinquency. In his study of ‘‘re-
bellious behavior’ at school, he found
that middle class students who failed at
school engaged in more ‘‘rebellious be-
havior’’ at school than lower class school
failures. Studies by Kelly (1971), Kelly
and Balch (1971), Frease (1973), and Polk
et al. (1974) have all provided moderate to
weak support for the hypothesis that mid-
dle class school failures engage in more
delinquent behavior than lower class
school failures.? Polk (1969), however,
failed to find any support for the hypothe-
sis: academically unsuccessful lower class
boys were found to be just as delinquent
as academically unsuccessful middle class
boys.

Since middle class children have higher
aspirations for success, it may be that
middle class school failures suffer from a
greater discrepancy between aspirations
and expectations of occupational success.
And it has been shown that children with a
great discrepancy between aspirations and
expectations are more likely than others
to engage in delinquency (Spergel, 1961;
Wood, 1961; Elliott, 1962; Spergel, 1967;
Fredericks and Molnar, 1969; Kelly,
1971).8 Moreover, middle class school
failures possibly become more delinquent
because they are under greater pressure to
succeed than lower class school failures,
and because they have further to fall
through downward occupational mobil-
ity.°

Hence there is, as Stark (1979) suggests,
a considerable body of theory and empiri-
cal evidence to support the paradox that
class inequality is responsible for much
middle class delinquency. This work
could, indeed, be taken much further than
it has to date. Perhaps a system which has
failure built into it fosters crime not only
among those who have objectively failed
(at work or school). There are also the
pathological consequences of anticipation
of failure, fear of failure, and failure to
achieve the success aspired to or ex-
pected. These are further arguments for
the proposition that the most needed types
of analyses are those which explore the
effects of class inequality on rates for vary-
ing types of crime aggregated across all
classes.

Tittle et al. (1978) choose not to dis-
agree with the Stark (1979) observation:

There does seem to be an empirical relation-
ship between class origin and academic per-
formance in high school. There also seems to
be a consistent and strong association be-
tween academic performance and delin-
quency. . . . Therefore it should follow that
there would be a strong class origin/
delinquency association, but of course, our
paper shows that in general such a relation-
ship has not been demonstrated. Either the
origin/performance or the performance/
delinquency association is in error or some
rather complex interactions are involved
which need to be sorted out empirically.
