      "with the traditional methods; it could be\n",
      "used to clarify some of their concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proceeding in this direction, we note that\n",
      "many acts are performed to avoid objects\n",
      "which are unpleasant to the individual. One\n",
      "may call them “negative,” since their most\n",

      "\n",
      "The nearest approach to a name befitting\n",
      "this group is “antipathy.” The definitions\n",
      "which are given in dictionaries and in the\n",
      "social science literature vary considerably,\n",
      "but there is one point of agreement among\n",

      "essary to start the analysis from the initial\n",
      "observation that the primary response to\n",
      "the “feeling” is an avoidance of the object.\n",
      "In an extended study (1,200 cases) it was\n",
      "found that the antipathetic reaction to ob-\n",
      "jects was not followed by any effort to\n",
      "avoid future encounters. The negative re-\n",

      "From comments gathered during two\n",
      "hundred interviews, the writer concludes\n",
      "that a person is seldom asked to describe his\n",
      "antipathies or to explain related conduct.\n",
      "He does not seek to defend himself or to\n",

      "the dislike of the color and adding that the\n",
      "taste has taken on the same negative tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "A considerable amount of our data in-\n",
      "dicates that antipathies are related to pri-\n",
      "mary sense areas. The weight of the evi-\n",
      "dence favors the single area, although there\n",
      "are cases where individuals were found to\n",
      "be antipathetic through two senses to a\n",
      "single object. The explanation is that these\n",
      "should be regarded as separate antipathies\n",
      "which are set off by the same stimulus.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a fairly strong fixation about an-\n",
      "tipathies, for many people who aided in this\n",

      "experiment with their “dislikes.”? The mat-\n",
      "ter is settled as far as they are concerned,\n",
      "but it was not found that such sensory ex-\n",
      "periences are permanently attached to those\n",
      "who hold them. They were not disturbed by\n",
      "the fact that they did not know the origin\n",

      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another important characteristic of an-\n",
      "tipathies is that they are marginal to re-\n",
      "flective consciousness. This was shown re-\n",
      "peatedly by the remarks made by our sub-\n",

      "this study disclosed an average of 21 per\n",

      "1,256 different antipathies, of which 37.9\n",
      "per cent were human physical traits and\n",
      "were related to parts of clothing or to man-\n",
      "nerisms. Since these were attached to in-\n",
      "dividuals, they appear to be capable of\n",
      "affecting social interaction in proportion to\n",
      "the degree of their intensity. These facts\n",

      "moner than we had assumed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a striking similarity between\n",
      "antipathies and allergies. But the differences\n",
      "are even greater.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. We note that allergies are physiologi-\n",
      "cal (or chemical) in nature, while antip-\n",
      "athies appear to be psychological, perhaps\n",
      "emotional in some cases.\n",
      "2. Antipathies are “feelings against” ob-\n",
      "jects but allergies act much too slowly to\n",
      "produce any quick avoidance. In many al-\n",
      "lergies the negative reaction does not take\n",
      "place at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. A person may be allergic to an object\n",
      "to which he is not antipathetic or vice versa.\n",
      "An individual may, in fact, show a decided\n",
      "liking for the object to which he is allergic.\n",
      "This trait bears no similarity to antipathetic\n",
      "behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Often one does not know what causes\n",
      "his allergy, and it must be discovered by\n",
      "medical observation. In contrast to this, one\n",
      "has no difficulty in finding his antipathetic\n",
      "objects, for his senses make them known to\n",
      "him. One may have hay fever and not know\n",
      "what a ragweed looks like, but if he dislikes\n",
      "the odor of fish glue he has no difficulty in\n",
      "locating the object.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Allergies often so affect the organism\n",
      "that there is a prolonged and even incapaci-\n",
      "tating aftereffect. The writer has never\n",
      "found this in the case of antipathies.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Some antipathies are picked up from\n",
      "other persons. It is exceedingly doubtful if\n",
      "allergies are learned.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Antipathies are directly related to the\n",
      "primary sense areas, but allergies may op-\n",
      "erate in the organism without irritating any\n",
      "major nerve center.\n",
      "\n",
      "We tend to underestimate the social role\n",
      "of antipathies because, for one thing, they\n",
      "seldom force us to deal with them on an in-\n",
      "tellectual level. It is difficult for people to\n",
      "analyze their own antipathies because sen-\n",
      "sory experiences are nearly always hard, to\n",
      "describe; an effort to do so usually results in\n",
      "likening them to something similar. This\n",
      "would fail, however, where two people have\n",
      "not had the same experience. We can also\n",
      "imagine how one who feels our antipathy\n",
      "would simply withdraw, even when it meant\n",
      "avoiding people, and yet fail to realize how\n",
      "they feel about his behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another factor in our failure to appreci-\n",
      "ate the social importance of antipathies is\n",
      "that the objects which serve as stimuli are\n",
      "treated by the individual as nonresponding.\n",
      "In consequence, the individual does not see\n",
      "any necessity of setting barriers against the\n",
      "object of antipathy or of making plans to\n",
      "control it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The individual, furthermore, does not\n",
      "feel that his experiences are subject to ethi-\n",
      "cal evaluation, for he sees neither good nor\n",
      "evil in them. His behavior appears to be\n",
      "without fault, of no social consequence,\n",
      "and of no interest to others. We cannot quite\n",
      "agree with him.\n",
      "\n",
      "One may wish to ask whether antipathies\n",
      "have any use and, if so, what it is. The an-\n",
      "swer is in the affirmative: they fit into a set\n",

      "presented to show that withdrawals are\n",
      "often from objects which would do the or-\n",
      "ganism no harm; but that would be a logical\n",
      "deduction, and logic does not operate in\n",
      "antipathetic behavior. Through many in-\n",

      "does not penetrate to the sensory level of\n",
      "antipathies; therefore their voluntary elim-\n",
      "ination does not appear very probable.\n",
      "\n",
      "A study of the geographical distribution\n",
      "of antipathetic objects shows that they\n",

      "culture areas. This becomes evident when\n",
      "one recalls that people cannot be antipa-\n",
      "thetic to objects with which they have had\n",
      "no experience. Thus antipathies which are\n",
      "found among pre-literates might vary con-\n",

      "the idea that some antipathies are innate or\n",
      "due to organic peculiarities.4\n",
      "\n",
      "We have abundant evidence to show that\n",
      "people are able to take up antipathies from\n",
      "their cultural environment. For instance,\n",
      "antipathies to foods refer to those which are\n",
      "found in a given vicinity, some of which,\n",
      "like garlic, may have been introduced from\n",
      "other cultures.\n",
      "\n",
      "If one were to judge by the origin of the\n",
      "words “sympathy” and “antipathy,” one\n",
      "might say that one is the antithesis of the\n",
      "other. Whether we use the popular under-\n",
      "standing of “sympathy” or the more precise\n",
      "sociological meaning, we can readily see that\n",
      "the two are not opposed.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Sympathy means a “feeling with”\n",
      "objects; and that distinguishes it from antip-\n",
      "athy. Moreover, sympathy involves some\n",
      "reasoning and is thus on a level with social\n",
      "values and above antipathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Sympathy usually indicates a sharing\n",
      "of the joy or sorrow that another feels. At\n",
      "the least, it leads to an understanding of the\n",
      "other and consequently tends to bring per-\n",

      "doubts if it could be reduced to the level of\n",
      "“consciousness of kind” or “gregarious-\n",
      "ness,” since they descend too deeply to be\n",

      "organisms to be in sympathetic contact,\n",
      "they must have similar sensory equipment.\n",
      "This neurological likeness may exist only in\n",
