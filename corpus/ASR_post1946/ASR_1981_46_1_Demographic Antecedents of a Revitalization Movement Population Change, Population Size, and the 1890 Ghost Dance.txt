The 1890 Ghost Dance movement
among certain American Indian peoples
has received a variety of scholarly atten-
tion. The classic description is Mooney’s
The Ghost-Dance Religion and the Sioux
Outbreak of 1890 (1896), though Grinnell
(1891), Lesser (1933), Dobyns and Euler
(1967) and LaBarre (1972) also offer de-
scriptions. Whether this dance may be
joined with similar American Indian
dances in a sequence of evolution and/or
diffusion is debated. Spier (1935) and Sut-
tles (1957) argue that the 1890 Dance
evolved from the 1870 Ghost Dance,
which in turn evolved from the Prophet
Dance; however, Mooney (1896) consid-
ers the 1890 Dance a unique phenomenon
with historical parallels but not origins.
Attention is also focused on the Ghost
Dance as arising from social and cultural
deprivations which the Indian peoples ex-
perienced after contact with white popu-
lations (e.g., studies by Lesser [1933],
Barber [1941] and Dobyns and Euler
[1967]). The Dance as a result of a psy-
chological prophet or messiah process is
examined by Fletcher (1891) and Overholt
(1974).

In the past, little attention was devoted
to which tribes did or did not participate in
the Ghost Dance and to reasons which
might account for the difference. When
these issues were considered, typically
only a mention was made that some Indian
peoples knew of the Dance but did not
participate or participated minimally, with
an occasional speculation offered as to
reasons. (An exception is Hill’s [1944]
brief discussion of why the Navaho did
not participate.) Recently, Carroll (1975)
examined differential acceptance of the
Ghost Dance, using the variables of tribal
distance from the Dance’s origin, depri-
vations resulting from destruction of buf-
falo herds, and political, kinship, and in-
heritance structures. Following Carroll,
Brown (1976) examined tribal acceptance
and dependence on hunting and the de-
struction of the buffalo; and Landsman
(1979) studied acceptance and dates of
land allotment.

Often the 1890 Ghost Dance was linked
to the general study of social movements.
Carroll (1975), following Wallace (1956),
characterized the Dance as a revitalization
movement attempting to restructure broad
social and cultural relations. Lanternari
(1963), likewise, discussed it as an in-
A possible relationship between the
Ghost Dance movement and the destruc-
tion of the American Indian population
has been suggested but not studied. For
example, both Mooney (1896:826-7, 830)
and Barber (1941:664, 666) mention Ameri-
can Indian population decimation as a de-
privation preceding the Ghost Dance, but
neither examines the possibility. Simi-
larly, Brown (1976:742) refers to the im-
portance of population changes in dif-
ferential acceptance of the Dance by In-
dian peoples but does not pursue it. This
neglect is particularly ironic, given the ex-
pressed objective of the Dance itself and
the demographic context in which it de-
veloped.

A primary objective of the 1890 Ghost
Dance was the return of the dead
(Mooney, 1896:772, 777; Worsley,
1957:223). As Mooney (1896:777) writes,

The great underlying principle of the
Ghost Dance doctrine is that the time will
come when the whole Indian race, living and
dead, will be reunited upon a regenerated
earth, to live a life of aboriginal happiness,
forever free from death, disease and misery.
The historic context of the Ghost Dance
is likewise important. It occurred at the
end of a century that was demographically
devastating to American Indians. From a
total size of about 600,000 in 1800, the
American Indian population was deci-
mated through disease, relocation, star-
vation, genocide, and social and cultural
destruction (Hadley, 1957) to an 1890
nadir of only 228,000 (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1915:10). This devastation was
perhaps particularly severe for those
tribes that occupied or would in future
occupy lands west of the Mississippi River
in the area of the Ghost Dance.

The objective of the Ghost Dance and
historic timing suggest that the movement
was, at least in part, an attempted demo-
graphic revitalization to recover popula-
tion losses. (The recovery would then lead
to the renewal of Indian societies and
cultures, and the consequent assurance of
tribal survival.)

If this reasoning is correct and if the
suggested importance of population de-
struction to the occurrence of the Ghost
Dance and other such social movements is
also correct, then participation by a tribe
probably would have been influenced by
its population characteristics. Charac-
teristics related to size were probably
critical, particularly changes in size prior
to, and absolute size at the time of, the
Dance. The rationale relates to threats to
demographic survival and, hence, partici-
pation in the Ghost Dance as an attempt
at demographic revitalization. Tribes ex-
periencing severe population declines
would have been more threatened than
tribes experiencing only moderate de-
clines or even increases. Similarly,
smaller tribes would perhaps have been
more threatened than larger ones.
the Dance and, then, distinguishing those
participating from those not. These tasks
were accomplished using three sources of
information: (1) Mooney’s (1896) report
on the 1890 Ghost Dance; (2) other an-
thropological discussion of the movement
by Grinnell (1891), Kroeber (1925),
Gayton (1930), Lesser (1933), Spier
(1927), Dobyns and Euler (1967), LaBarre
(1972), and Heizer (1978); (3) the work on
acceptance by Hill (1944), Carroll (1975;
1976; 1979), Brown (1976) and Landsman
(1979).

A listing of Indian groups, whether as
tribes, major tribal divisions or reser-
vations, mentioned by Mooney (1896) was
first established. It was then narrowed by
excluding all those not reasonably ex-
pected to have heard of the movement,
determined primarily from Mooney’s
comments and his map (1896:Plate
LXXXV) showing the Dance’s approx-
imate area and locating tribes inside or
outside this area.! The other cited dis-
cussions and studies of the Ghost Dance
were also used. The latter literature was
secondary, though extremely valuable in
instances (e.g., the discussion of the
Dance in California found in Kroeber
[1925] and in Heizer [1978]). The remain-
ing tribal groups were then classified as
participants or nonparticipants, using the
same sources of information.

A third task established the tribal units
for analysis. Deciding what is an appro-
priate unit of an American Indian people
(e.g., tribe, subtribe, band, etc.) is an old,
extremely complicated problem. It is
compounded by the reservation system
whereby distinct peoples have been di-
vided and/or combined with others on
land areas. Given the variables associated
with size, it was decided to generally
avoid subtribal distinctions and geo-
graphical designations as these could im-
pose an artificial ‘‘smallness.’’ However,
Mooney (1896) was generally followed

' Carroll (1975; 1976; 1979), Brown (1976) and
Landsman (1979) contain classifications of tribal ex-
posure to and acceptance of the Ghost Dance but do
not mention Mooney’s (1896) map, an extremely
valuable source of information in this regard. They
also do not cite the original edition of Mooney’s
(1896) study, as used here, but cite such abridged
editions (Mooney, 1965) or reprinted ones (Mooney,
1973).
Obtaining valid information as to size of
American Indian populations has histori-
cally been difficult. Reasons include lack
of full census coverage until 1890, tribal
movements and relocations, inaccessibil-
ity of American Indians, and issues of tri-
bal and individual definition.

Circumstances were fortuitous for as-
certaining tribal sizes for periods of inter-
est, however. First, Mooney’s (1896)
work contains population figures for many
tribes, subtribes, and reservations at the
time of exposure to the Ghost Dance.
Second, the period coincided with the
1890 Census (U.S. Bureau of the Census,
1894), the first providing complete enu-
meration of both reservation and nonreser-
vation American Indians. Thus, Mooney’s
figures could be supplemented from this
census. These sources provided fairly
good population data for the Ghost Dance
period. Third, a report of the Board of
Indian Commissioners (1877) containing
relatively complete population figures for
tribes and/or reservations of the mid-1870s
had been published. Populations at that
time could be compared with those of the
Ghost Dance period to ascertain recent
change in size. Fourth, Mooney (1928)
had also published individual tribal popu-
lations at first extensive European contact
(ranging, according to Mooney, from the
year 1600 to the year 1845). Sizes at this
time could thus be compared with 1890
sizes, and change over a long period as-
certained. (Unfortunately, information
was not always available for comparable
tribes or reservations so that other
sources were occasionally utilized.)

Resulting populations at each of the
three dates for the seventy American In-
dian groups exposed to the Ghost Dance
of 1890 are in the Appendix. Ascertaining
change became a straightforward task of
subtracting size for different dates to ar-
rive at a decrease or increase.
Unfortunately, the population data has
two potential sources of error. The first is
inherent historical error in estimating,
enumerating, and reporting sizes for
American Indians, resulting in error in
published census and other figures used as
(or used to obtain) the specific population
data. The second potential for error is the
impossibility of always obtaining data for
the same year, from the same source, or
for the same tribal unit. This results in
error in the comparability of figures re-
ported here. Both sources of error are un-
avoidable. Both are also basically unmea-
surable (i.e., it is not possible to ascer-
tain the amount of error, if any). It is pos-
sible, however, to reduce, considerably,
any error in these data as used for
analysis, by a simple dichotomization of
each population variable. In this case,
error may be considered slight, as it would
result only from a tribe being listed in the
wrong one of the two categories.
tion estimates do not include some sub-
tribal distinctions made here (e.g., for
the Sioux) and also combine certain tribes
not combined here (e.g., the Gosiute and
Ute). As a result, this analysis includes
only fifty of the seventy tribes.

The history of United States Indian
populations shows population decline
since first European contact. Only five of
the fifty tribes experienced population
gains from first extensive European con-
tact to the 1890s. This variable is therefore
primarily amount of decrease. It was
dichotomized as decline of 50% or more
or less than 50%.

Decline from first extensive European
contact was then related to participation.
As shown in Table 2, there is no signifi-
cant relationship between participation
and population decline from the time of
contact until the 1890s.
Population size was clearly important in
whether a tribe was part of the Ghost
Dance movement, as it is strongly related
to participation. It is surprising that
population decrease from first extensive
contact with Europeans to the time of the
Ghost Dance is not related to participa-
tion. It is interesting that population
decrease/increase from the 1870s to the
1890s was neither as strongly nor as sig-
nificantly related to participation, as was
absolute size.

As size was important, then perhaps
changes in it were associated with partici-
pation only for tribes of a certain size.
Certainly, small tribes would have been
more threatened than large ones by popu-
lation losses, particularly severe losses. If
this were so, then positive relationships
between Ghost Dance participation and
both amount of decline from first exten-
sive European contact and the population
decrease/increase from the 1870s for small
tribes (but not necessarily for large ones)
may be expected.”
To examine this, the same dichotomi-
zation was made as was used to examine
the relationship between size and partici-
pation. Relationships between participa-
tion and both population decline from
contact to the 1890s and population
decrease/increase from the 1870s to the
1890s were then reassessed.

1870s to 1890s change. Relationships,
by size, between population decrease/
increase from the 1870s and participation
in the Ghost Dance were examined first.
As indicated in Table 4, controlling for
size had different effects on the original
relationship, reducing it in one instance,
increasing it in the other.

As expected, there is a large, positive
relationship between participation and
population decrease/increase for small
tribes. This relationship is larger than the
original relationship. In fact, all but one of
the 27 small tribes with population de-
creases for the fifteen to twenty years
prior to exposure to the Ghost Dance par-
ticipated. Although no prediction was
made, the relationship between participa-
tion and population decrease/increase for
large tribes is reduced considerably from
the original, and is not significant.

European contact to the 1890s
change. Table 5 presents the relation-
ships, by size, between population decline
from first extensive European contact and
tribal participation in the Ghost Dance.
Whereas there was originally no signifi-
cant relationship, there are now two sig-
nificant relationships: one positive, the
other negative.

The relationship of + .85 for small tribes
is as expected. Small tribes with popula-
tion declines of 50% or more were consid-
erably more likely to have participated
than those with declines of less than 50%.
There was, in fact, only a single ‘small
tribe with a population decline of over
50% that did not participate.

Although no prediction was made, the
relationship of —.80 between decline and
participation is surprising. In fact, there is
only one large tribe with a population de-
cline of 50% or more that did participate in
the Ghost Dance, while the remaining nine
with similar declines did not.

Date of European contact. The nega-
tive relationship between population de-
cline and participation for large tribes
seems a real anomaly. Why would large
tribes with very large declines tend so
strongly not to participate? Small tribes
with similar declines tend equally strongly
to participate, as do small tribes with re-
cent increases, but large tribes with recent
population changes show no particular
pattern.

A possible reason might lie in the length
of time of these declines. It may have been
that large losses, over a long time, which
did not result in relatively small popula-
tions, did not threaten survival. Such
losses may even have served to reaffirm
tribal survival, hence the nonparticipation
of these tribes in the Dance.

To investigate this, it was decided to
relate participation to the date of first ex-
tensive contact with Europeans, by size of
tribe. If the reasoning is correct, then
there should be a positive relationship
between participation and recency of first
extensive contact for large tribes, par-
ticularly since the majority of tribes expe-
rienced decline during this period.*

Dates were dichotomized into before
and after the year 1700. As indicated in
Table 6, there is a moderate, positive re-
lationship between recency of extensive
European contact and tribal participation.

This overall relationship was then reas-
sessed for both large tribes and small
tribes, as reported in Table 7. The ex-
pected pattern proved true: there is a
Demographic characteristics examined
here are important in explaining the dif-
ferential involvement of American Indian
tribes in the 1890 Ghost Dance movement.
Both population change and absolute size
are important. However, size seems to be
more important than change and is related
strongly to: Ghost Dance participation,
overall. Size also influences the relation-
ships between population change and par-
ticipation (as well as the effects of length
of extensive European contact on partici-
pation). Inspections of table cells show
the Ghost Dance involvement of the small
tribes, especially those with population
declines, to have been almost total. This
was not the case with large tribes. How-
ever, noninvolvement of tribes in the Ghost
