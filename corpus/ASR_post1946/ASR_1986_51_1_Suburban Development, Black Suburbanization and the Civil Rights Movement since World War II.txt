Structural models of suburban development and black population growth are
developed for each of the post World War II decades. Changes in the determinants
(region, age, distance to the central city, socioeconomic status, area, job
concentration and population size) of black growth across the post-war decades are
examined within the context of changing black-white relations. In addition, the
reciprocal issue of change in the effect of black suburbanization on suburban devel-
opment (population, job and areal growth) is examined. The basic thesis is that
change in the process of black suburbanization has occurred during the post war
decades in response to the changing Civil Rights climate. Maximum likelihood model
estimates are generated for each decade using samples of all suburbs which had at
least 10,000 population during each decade. The analysis shows that the determi-
nants of black growth and the role of black suburbanization in suburban development
have changed across the decades.
national total of suburban residents (17 to 20
percent) but since World War II through 1980,
the percent suburban population has increased
from 20 to about 40 percent (Muller, 1981:51).
By 1970, almost all of metropolitan growth
(95.6 percent) was due to the growth of fringe
populations (U.S. Census of Population, 1970).

The suburbanization of commerce and in-
dustry has paralleled suburban population
growth. The deconcentration of economic ac-
tivities began in the 1920s with the increased
use of the automobile but it wasn’t until after
World War II with the increasing movement of
retailing to the fringe that job suburbanization
became a noticeable phenomenon. Suburban
employment has accelerated in each decade
since World War II, especially during the 1970s
(Muller, 1981:121). Initially, a large proportion
of the suburbanizing employment was in re-
tailing, but recently manufacturing as well as
wholesaling and administrative activities have
begun to suburbanize in increasing numbers. In
some ways, the fringe is displacing the central
city as the economic focus of the metropolis
(Sly and Tayman 1980a, 1980b).

The suburbanization of blacks, however, has
not followed the trends for population and em-
ployment suburbanization. In 1970, blacks
comprised about 11 percent of the total U.S.
population and about 12 percent of the met-
ropolitan population, but comprised only about
5 percent of the suburban residents. Since
World War I (through 1970), suburban percent
black has increased only slightly from about
3.0 to 5 parcent. In northern and western sub-
urban rings, blacks have remained a constant
three percent, while in southern rings percent
black has declined from about thirty percent in
1900 to about ten percent in 1970 (Farley,
1970). Suburban blacks have also displayed
segregated residential patterns similar to cen-
tral city blacks (Stahura, 1983; Logan and
Schneider, 1984). The persistent under-
representation of blacks in the fringe as well as
the segregated residential pattern has been of
considerable interest to researchers in that
these ecological patterns are argued to be the
outcome of housing discrimination practiced
by a variety of agents, including real estate
developers, lending institutions, city, state and
federal governments, etc. (Muller, 1981).

During the past 20 years, however, blacks
have begun to move to suburbs in increasing
numbers and at a greater rate (Nelson, 1978,
1980; Connolly, 1973; Logan and Schneider,
1984). In the suburbs in this study, percent
black has grown from 4.05 in 1950, to 4.20 in
1960, to 4.80 in 1970, to 7.14 in 1980. The
increase in black suburbanization implies that
the suburban fringe has been “opened” to
blacks and that discrimination practiced by
various agents described by Muller (1981) has
diminished. The reduction in suburban
exclusionism is assumed to have resulted from
the Civil Rights legislation of the 1950s and
1960s.

This study examines the parallels between
the Civil Rights movement and changes in the
process of black suburbanization. The basic
thesis is that the determinants of black subur-
ban population growth have changed across
the post-war decades in response to the
changing racial climate. A related thesis is that
changes in the determinants of suburban de-
velopment (areal, population and job growth)
have also occurred, especially the role of black
suburbanization. In Figure 1 is the model
which explicates the reciprocal relationship
The rapid acceleration in suburbanization
during the 1950s was fueled by the deferred
demand for housing created by World War II
and the pre-war housing shortage. After the
war, families began to spend their considerable
war years’ savings for new housing; returning
servicemen were able to easily secure housing
loans guaranteed by the Federal Housing and
Veterans Administration; and the delayed mar-
riages and fertility caused by the war produced
the increasing demand for new housing. Muller
(1981:54) states that nearly 10 million new
households were formed in the decade follow-
ing the end of the war. The construction in-
dustry responded to the massive demand by
mass-producing housing on suburban tracts.
This housing was cheaper and, in many ways,
superior to similar central-city housing. The
economic accessibility of fringe housing
coupled with strong demand produced a
central-city suburban migration stream which
far surpassed that of previous decades.

By the late 1950s, retailing activities began to
move to suburbs to service the newly arrived
immigrants who were rapidly losing their ties
to Central Business District’s (CBD) retailing.
Initially, retailing took the form of smaller
‘strip’ shopping areas which were later
supplanted during the 1960s by the larger
“mall” type shopping centers (Muller, 1981).
During the 1950s, other types of economic ac-
tivities began to decentralize, but only at a
fraction of the pace of later decades.

The suburbs of the 1950s were primarily
white enclaves with only a small number of
predominately black fringe “towns” which
existed before the post war suburbanization
(Rose, 1972), several older ‘satellite’? suburbs
which contained some black population, and
“spillover” ghettos located adjacent to the
central-city black enclaves (e.g., Farley, 1970;
Muller, 1981). Blacks were, in fact, excluded
from the newer suburbs by existing institu-
tional discrimination such as the discrimi-
natory practices in the administration of FHA
loans, and newer exclusionary zoning ordi-
nances.' Exclusionary zoning ordinances were

Blacks also shared in the post-war prosperity
in that the GI Bill of Rights, Veterans Admin-
istration and the Federal Housing Authority
provided avenues for better jobs, education
and housing. Black expectations rose even
further with the legal demise of the ‘separate
but equal’ educational systems in 1954. In the
remaining years of the 1950s, much of the ef-
fort of the Civil Rights movement focused on
educational gains, paying little attention to dis-
criminatory housing practices. The issue of
white ‘“‘suburbia’’ was of secondary im-
portance.

As a result, black suburban growth during
the 1950s was confined primarily to suburbs
with existing black populations. The best pre-
dictor, then, of black change should be the
size of the existing black population, i.e., the
relationship between 1950 percent black and
1960 percent black in Figure 1 should be large.
In addition, those suburbs developing least
rapidly are the ones most likely to have black
population growth. Specifically, old suburbs
(Farley, 1970; Schnore, et al., 1976; Connolly
1973), low in socioeconomics status (Logan
and Schneider, 1984; Marshall and Stahura,
1979a; 1979b), large in area and population size
(Marshall and Stahura, 1979a; 1979b) which are
close to the central city (Logan and Schneider,
1984; Muller, 1981) and which have smaller job
concentrations (Farley, 1970; Marshall and
Stahura, 1979a; 1979b) are hypothesized to
have growing black populations. Finally, re-
gional differences in suburban black growth are
hypothesized, given the findings of Logan and
Schneider (1984) and Marshall and Stahura
(1979a). The rationales for these determinants
of black change have been explicated and em-
pirically demonstrated in the cited research
and are not repeated here to conserve space.
The above hypotheses refer to the cross-lagged
relationships depicted in Figure 1, i.e., the
effects of area, population size, job concen-
tration, status, age, region, distance at time 1
on percent black at time 2. In addition to
the above specified ‘‘change’’ effects
(Bohrnstedt, 1969), the cross-sectional effects
of area, population, jobs, status, age, distance,
region and percent black on each other are also
specified in Figure 1. The cross-sectional ef-
fects are not relevant to the basic theses but are
causally ordered in lieu of estimating the cor-
relations between residuals (size, area, jobs
and percent black) at each time point.? The
arguments for the cross-sectional effects are
repetitive (similar to the change arguments)
and are not presented to conserve space.
Considering the determinants of suburban
development, percent black is hypothesized to
be negatively related to population, areal and
job growth. The presence of a black population
is argued to inhibit suburban development in
that white suburban migrants and economic
activities tend to avoid suburbs with black
populations since such suburbs generally have
poorer services and higher tax rates than white
suburbs (Logan and Schneider, 1981a;
Schneider and Logan, 1981) and since irra-
tional fears about property values, etc., based
on racial prejudice, influence locational deci-
sions of individuals and of business/industry.
Black suburbs, then, not allowed to share in
the benefits of the post-war boom give FHA
practices. Further, the newer practice of ex-
clusionary zoning steered black migrants to
suburbs which had little potential for develop-
ment. Suburban population growth and in-
creasing job concentration are also hypoth-
esized to be related to areal size, age, region,
distance and status. Suburbs with large
amounts of land have greater potential for
housing and industrial/commercial expansion.
Older suburbs have lower growth potential
since larger proportions of their land are al-
ready developed and because redevelopment is
more costly than developing land with no pre-
vious usage. Older suburbs, therefore, are hy-
pothesized to have slower population growth
(or decline) and slower increases in job con-
centration. Socioeconomic status is also hy-
pothesized to be positively related to job and
population increase (Stahura and Marshall,
1982). Regional differences in suburban popu-
lation (Stahura and Marshall, 1982; Guest,
1979) and job growth (Stahura, 1982) are also
anticipated based on previous research. Annex-
ation is hypothesized to be related to region,
status and distance from the central city. Sta-
hura and Marshall (1982) have shown that re-
gional differences in annexation exist (more in
south and west) and that high status suburbs are
also more likely to annex than are low status
suburbs. Suburbs which are further from the
central city are also more likely to annex given
that they are less likely to be bounded by de-
veloped land and/or incorporated cities.

Finally, the 1950 indicators of suburban de-
velopment (area, population, jobs) are hypoth-
esized to be highly related to the 1960 values.
Previous studies have demonstrated the per-
sistence of such characteristics (e.g. Guest,
1978; Stahura, 1978; 1979, 1982; Stahura and
Marshall, 1982) and there is no reason to an-
ticipate otherwise. More importantly, the
character of suburbanization did not change
during the decade so as to alter the ranking of
suburbs with respect to size, area and job con-
centration; growing suburbs continued to grow
rapidly while stagnant suburbs showed little
growth.
235) which provided direct home-ownership
subsidies to low-income families. Title 235 and
its companion Title 236 program (rent subsidies
to low-income families) provided the economic
resources to low-incime families to obtain the
housing made available by the Federal Housing
legislation. Black expectations were rising as
the Civil Rights movement challenged every
form of institutionalized racism.

Rising black expectations, however, were
short-circuited to some degree. The gains made
in federal legislation had little effect on exclu-
sionary zoning practices of white suburbia.
Zoning originated from enabling acts passed by
State legislatures, and challenges to exclusion-
ary zoning were rarely heard in Federal courts.
Through the mid-1960s, legal decisions on local
zoning strongly supported suburban
exclusionism (for a review see Babcock, 1973;
Masotti and Hadden, 1974; Platt, 1976; and
Williams, 1978). The rising expectations were
also frustrated by the continuation of discrimi-
nation, especially in housing and education.
This frustration lead to greater militancy
(Williams, 1965; Lieberson and Silverman,
1965) during the middle and late 1960s which
took the form of widespread urban unrest.

Suburbanization of population and economic
activities continued during the 1960s. Popula-
tion movement remained high but held a
somewhat slower pace than in the 1950s (Mul-
ler, 1981) while the suburbanization of eco-
nomic activities began to accelerate. The de-
mands for new housing remained high; massive
suburban shopping malls were supplanting
CBD retailing; and manufacturing began to
leave central city areas for cheaper, available
fringe land with lower tax rates. Suburbs con-
tinued to endorse population and job growth as
avenues to development.

Spurred by the Civil Rights legislation and
subsidy programs, larger numbers of blacks
began to move to the suburbs (e.g. Connolly,
1973), though to those that already contained
black populations (e.g. Marshall and Stahura,
1979a, Schnore et al., 1976). Despite the con-
tinuing propensity to move to black fringe
towns, satellites and ghettoized ‘spillover’
black suburbs, there also developed a new
“leapfrog” type of ghettoized suburb (iden-
tified by Rose, 1972) located in white areas
beyond the spillover ghettoes. These “‘leap-
frog” suburbs contained less desirable housing
(than adjacent areas) for which white demand
had declined. Blacks were being allowed into
some white suburbs because of the lowering
white demand for the older housing, because
of the changing civil rights climate, and be-
cause of the spectre of civil unrest.

As a result of these trends, 1960 percent
black is hypothesized to be highly related to
1970 percent black, but to a lesser extent than
in the 1950s, since some previously white sub-
urbs experienced black population growth. The
remaining determinants of black change are
also hypothesized to have changed during the
1960s in that black growth, even though still
primarily centered in older, lower-status,
larger suburbs with low job concentrations,
also was occurring in the newly “pioneered”
suburbs whose characteristics may or may not
match those of the other suburbs with black
populations. Some change in the effects of age,
status, etc. on black growth is therefore antici-
pated. Given that 1960 percent black is hy-
pothesized to explain less of the variance in
1970 percent black than during the 1950s, the
remaining determinants of change have more
residual variance to explain—hence their ef-
fects should be somewhat larger than for the
1950s. In addition, it is hypothesized that per-
cent black continued to be negatively related to
suburban development in that black suburbs
were still being bypassed by job expansion and
population growth. Finally, the 1960 indicators
of suburban development (area, jobs, popula-
tion) are again expected to be highly correlated
to 1970 levels, and the determinants of change
in development during the 1960s should be
similar to those-of the 1950s.
black residency (using suburbs in this analysis
as the data base). As white suburbanization
diminished, black suburbanization and job
suburbanization increased.

The Civil Rights movement during the 1970s
can be characterized as a period of retrench-
ment and consolidation (Pettigrew, 1980:
314-19). The momentum towards change pro-
duced by the legislative successes of the 1960s
and the pressure created by black activism was
short-circuited by the social movement against
the Viet Nam War and the assassination or
imprisonment of many black leaders (Parrillo,
1985:332). As a result few major pieces of Civil
Rights legislation were produced during the
1970s and, in fact, a number of legislative set-
backs occurred. Federal judicial actions of the
1970s generally upheld the Civil Rights gains of
the 60s, but the executive branch of govern-
ment, especially the Nixon administration,
began to erode the gains with Congressional
action. For example, the Title 235 and 236 sub-
sidy acts (1968) were gutted by 1974, due to
severe cutbacks in funds.

Setbacks also occurred in the legislative fight
to “open up” white suburbia. The apparent
demise of exclusionary zoning due to the 1975
Mount Laurel, New Jersey, decision (see Rose
and Rothman, 1977) was a hollow victory for
the Civil Rights movement in that later legisla-
tion diluted the decision to make it applicable
only to cities that were not already built up as
single-family residential areas. Moreover, with
the decline in public funds for the subsidy of
low-income housing, suburban development of
low-income housing was not likely to occur,
given that this type of construction is usually a
losing proposition to private builders. What-
ever progress was achieved by the Mount
Laurel Decision was more than negated by the
Petaluma, California, decision (Fosburgh,
1975) which legitimized the suburb’s use of
zoning to limit new housing construction. The
Petaluma decision gave developed suburbs a
mechanism to continue to exclude blacks and
other groups at the price of restricting growth.
Several other decisions concerning Hartford,
Connecticut (see Fellows, 1975; 1976) and
Chicago (especially Hills vs. Gantreauz, 1976)
also failed to force suburbs to accept lower-
income housing.

Given the continuance of exclusionary zon-
ing and the retrenchment in the Civil Rights
movement, the best predictor of 1980 percent
black should be 1970 percent black; the re-
lationship should be larger than that for the
1960s. The 1970 ranking of suburbs in terms of
percent black should be relatively unchanged
in 1980 in that few, if any, new suburbs were
opened to black occupancy. The “leapfrog”
pattern of black suburbanization (Rose, 1972)
of the 1960s did not continue into the 1970s.
The effects of the other determinants of black
change should also have changed. Given that
percent black is hypothesized to become a
more important determinant of black change,
the remaining determinants of black growth
(age, status, area, etc.) should become less im-
portant, given the more restricted residual
variance in 1980 percent black. Also, since few
new suburbs have been opened to blacks, the
nature of the relationship (sign directions) be-
tween age, status, and black change should
remain the same as for the 1960s.

The relationships between 1970 measures of
area, population size and job concentration and
1980 measures are also hypothesized to have
changed. Given the increased volume of job
suburbanization and the decline in white sub-
urbanization, the competition between suburbs
for these resources has taken on a different
character. As white, higher status migrants be-
came scarcer, some suburbs were not able to
maintain the same growth rate as previous dec-
ades, while they continued to exclude blacks.
Hence, some shift in the ranking of suburbs in
terms of population growth is likely to have
occurred. With the increase in the volume of
job suburbanization, suburbs that could not
previously compete successfully for these jobs
were now in a position to benefit from the more
selective development policies (growth caps
and exclusion of nondesirable industries) being
adopted by higher status suburbs. In fact, the
conditions of the 1970s have given rise to a
movement toward policies of restricted growth
(e.g. Molotch, 1976). As a result, job growth
should be affecting a broader spectrum of
suburbs than in previous decades, producing a
change in the ranking of suburbs in terms of job
concentration.

The role of percent black in suburban devel-
opment is hypothesized to have also changed.
With the increase in the volume of black sub-
urbanization, percent black may now (com-
pared to the 50s and 60s) have a positive effect
on the suburb’s overall population growth. In
addition, some of these “black” suburbs may
also have benefited from the deflection of less
desirable economic activities from the more
selective suburbs. Given the movement
towards growth caps, especially by higher-
status suburbs, percent black may no longer be
detrimental to job growth. Specifically, percent
black is hypothesized to be either positively
related or unrelated to suburban development
compared to the negative relationship of previ-
ous decades.
is estimated for the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s
using maximum likelihood techniques (Jores-
kog and Sorbom, 1978). The estimated models
are then compared across decades. Ordinary
least-squares techniques can be used to esti-
mate the models and, in fact, yield quite similar
results to the estimates reported in Table 1.
However, LISREL was chosen as the statisti-
cal technique for two reasons: the procedure
used to compare the models necessitates the
use of LISREL and correlated residuals, and
model fit parameters are generated as standard
output in LISREL. The sample sizes for each
individual decade analysis are 426 for 1950—
1960; 826 for 1960-1970; and 1163 for the
1970-1980 analysis. For the comparisons be-
tween models, for the 1950-1960 model to
1960-1970, and 1970-1980 data, the sample
size is 426. For the comparison of 1960-1970
model to 1970-1980 data, the sample size is
826. A suburb is defined as an incorporated
place of at least 10,000 population size located
within the bounds of a metropolitan area, but
outside its central city. The samples for each
decade comprise all cities that meet the defi-
nitional criteria. The operationalizations of the
variables, means, and standard deviations are
presented in Appendix A.
During the 1970s, the rankings of suburbs
with respect to population, area and job con-
centration shifted substantially, i.e., a signifi-
cant number of suburbs either grew or de-
clined at a faster pace than in previous dec-
ades. However, contrary to the earlier argu-
ment, some of the change resulted from an
unexpected source, that is, higher status sub-
urbs were the suburbs that exhibited the
greatest population and job growth during the
1970s (see columns 7 and 8, row 12 for the
1970-1980 model). It was expected that the
movement towards growth controls (Molotch,
1976) and the continuation of exclusionary
zoning among higher-status suburbs would
have allowed lower status suburbs to begin to
develop. However, higher-status suburbs con-
tinued to disproportionately benefit from
growth, creating greater status differentials
between suburb. Logan (1976; 1978) and espe-
cially Logan and Schneider (1981b) have dem-
onstrated that the stratification between sub-
urbs has indeed increased. What is most in-
teresting is that the disproportionate growth of
high-status suburbs is a more pronounced phe-
nomenon during the 1970s in that status had
only small positive effects on population
growth and small negative effects on job
growth during the 1950s and 1960s.

It may be that a singificant proportion of
high-status suburbs have aged to a point in
their life cycles where transition is beginning to
occur in the form of status downgrading and
slowing growth (see Hoover and Vernon, 1962;
Choldin, et al, 1980). In attempting to negate
the negative effects of status downgrading and
growth decline on tax revenues and to maintain
their advantaged positions vis-a-vis other sub-
urbs, some higher-status suburbs have begun
to actively seek out higher-status migrants
(perhaps even blacks) and businesses/
industries. This change in pattern of develop-
ment is reflected in the data in Table 1. Age
was negatively related to population growth in
the 1950s and 1960s but turned slightly positive

during the 1970s, while age was positively re-
lated to job growth during the 1950s and 1960s
but was not related to job growth during the
1970s (see columns 6, 7, row 9 in the three
panels of Table 1). Higher-status suburbs have
begun to turn to job growth as an avenue of
development.

The stability coefficients for percent black
changed across the decades in the anticipated
pattern. The 1950s and 1970s were similar in
that little change occurred in the ranking of
suburbs in terms of percent black, indicating
few suburbs changed in their black growth
pattern. During the 1960s, as hypothesized,
significant change occurred in the stability
coefficient in that a number of suburbs changed
their black growth pattern. The improving
race-relations climate opened some previously
all-white suburbs to blacks, but as Rose (1972)
has noted, these places tended to be lower-
status areas where white demand for housing
had declined. Nevertheless, some improve-
ment was noted during the 1960s in that the
increase in the volume of black migration
(Connolly, 1973) was paralleled by a positive
change in the black settlement pattern (more
suburbs with black populations). However, as
the high stability coefficient indicates, the
trend towards wider dispersal did not continue
into the 1970s despite the increase in black
suburbanization during the decade.

The changes in the remaining determinants
of black growth also conformed to the pre-
dicted pattern. It was hypothesized that the
determinants of black growth (age, region,
distance, status, area, population size and job
concentration) would account for more of the
variance in black growth during the 1960s than
during the 1950s or 1970s. Separate multiple
regression analyses indicated that the determi-
nants of black change (age, region, etc.) ac-
counted for more of the variance in black
growth during the 1960s than for the 1950s and
1970s.5 In addition, it was also demonstrated
that the block of change determinants signifi-
cantly improved in R? in each decade equation.

Turning to the individual determinants of
black growth, most were found to be small in
magnitude, though a number were statistically
significant (all non-zero coefficients reported in
Table 1 are statistically significant at the .05
level). In addition, some of these effects were
found to vary across the decade models as
hypothesized. Considering first the effects of
the endogenous variables on black growth,
area was predicted to be positively related to
black growth. The hypothesis, however, was
only supported by data from the 1950s. In the
1960s and 1970s larger suburbs experienced
slower black population growth. Apparently
those suburbs with the resources (land area) to
accommodate expansion and diversity in
population and function did not include blacks
in their development plans. Despite a small
decline in magnitude, population size exerted
the expected positive effect on black growth in
each decade. Suburban job concentration was
hypothesized to be negatively related to black
change, but the expected effect was only pre-
sent during the 1950s. The effect of job con-
centration on black growth was not statistically
significant during the 1960s and 1970s.

The effects of the exogenous variables on
black growth also changed in magnitude and
direction across the decades. Of particular
interest are changes in the effects of age and
socioeconomic status on black growth. The
effect of age on black growth during the 1950s
was negative, became positive during the
1960s, but was not significant during the 1970s.
Black growth is no longer concentrated in older
suburbs. That is, black populations in newer
suburbs are now growing at the same rate. Also
of importance is the change in the effect of
socioeconomic status on black growth across
the decades. During the 1950s and 1960s black
growth was negatively related to status as hy-
pothesized, but during the 1970s the relation-
ship changed to positive. Black growth has
shifted from lower-status suburbs to higher-
status suburbs. This finding does not mean that
black growth in the older, lower-class suburb
with black populations has stopped. What is
most likely is that ‘token’ black populations
that exist in a significant number of predomi-
nately white, higher-status suburbs are grow-
ing at a more rapid pace than those in lower-
status suburbs with larger black populations.
The bulk of black growth continues to be cen-
tered in suburbs with large black populations.

There were also significant changes in the
effects of black suburbanization on suburban
development (change in size, population and
job concentration), especially during the 1970s.
Evidence supporting the hypothesis that per-
cent black hinders suburban development is
found for the 1950s and 1960s (see horizontal
boxes in Table 1). Percent black is negatively
related to population growth in both decades,
while its effects on job growth were essentially
zero. Percent black had a significant effect on
land change (annexation) in the 1950s but this
effect disappeared in the 1960s. The overall net
effect of black suburbanization on suburban
development was negative or neutral at best
before 1970. During the 1970s, however, the
effect of percent black on suburban develop-
ment changed radically in that percent black
emerged as a positive determinant of popula-
tion, areal and job growth. Suburbs with black
populations began to develop disproportion-
ately in relation to other suburbs. Apparently
some of the benefits of life in suburbia have
begun to spill over into the older, lower-status
residential areas with black populations. The
population growth that is occurring may be due
primarily to black population growth, and the
job increase may be centered within those less
desirable activities that have been deflected
from white, higher-status suburbs. The net ef-
fect on black suburbs, however, should be
positive in terms of the strengthening of the tax
base.

The changes in the determinants of black
growth and suburban development depicted in
Table 1 were assumed to be statistically signifi-
cant. A formal test is made by comparing each
decade model with each other (SOs with the
60s, 60s with the 70s, and 70s with the 80s) by
utilizing incremental fit (or in this case, de-
crease in fit) techniques developed by Bentler
and Bonett (1980). An analysis reported in
the 1960s correlations and then the 1970s correla-
tions (in each case, the correlations are best on the
same cohort of suburbs, unlike the analyses in the
previous section). The generated fit (chi-square) of
the 1950s model to the 1960s data can then be com-
pared to the fit parameters for the null model. To the
extent that the fit of the new model digresses from
the null model, differences between the models can
be assumed.

In Appendix B are reported the results of the
model comparisons. The first panel (Model Test)
includes the results of the application of null models
(best fitting decade models) to correlations from suc-
ceeding decades. Models Mo, M, and Mp represent
the fit statistics for the null models, i.e., Mo is the
best-fitting 1950s model, M, is the best-fitting 1960s
model and Mp is the best-fitting 1970s model. Models
Mg and M, represent the comparisons between the
1950s model to the 1960s and 1970s models. Consid-
ering Ms, where the Mo structure (1950s) is fit to
1960s data, the chi-square value is 57.4098 compared
to a best-fitting 1950s model value of 4.6495. Consid-
ering Ma, where the Mb structure (1960s) is fit to the
1970s data, the chi-square value is 109.9028 com-
pared to a best-fit 1950s value of 4.6495. The 1950s
model is more similar to the 1960s model than it is to
the 1970s model—the same conclusion drawn by the
analysis in the previous section. Finally, considering
the M, model where the M, structure (1960s) is fit to
the 1970 data, the chi-square value is 121.511 com-
pared to a best fit value (1960s) of 3.4034. The 1960s
model is quite different from the 1970s model. The
formal comparisons between the models are made in
the second panel of Table 2 (Model comparisons)
where the Bentler-Bonett (1980) incremented fit in-
dices (A's) are presented. In each comparison, each
models appears to be a significant digression from
the null (best-fitting) models.
black populations in 1960 had black population
growth during the 1960s. However, the trend of
the 1960s did not continue into the 1970s
(BETA increased from .76 to .88). The court
cases of the 1970s (especially the Petaluma,
California decision) and the general retrench-
ment of the Civil Rights movement were clear
enough signals to suburbs that there were legal
and popular bases for excluding blacks and
other populations, whereas the initial legisla-
tive successes and activist pressures during the
1950s and 1960s might have encouraged or in-
timidated some suburbs in their open housing
policies. The historical parallels drawn be-
tween the course of the Civil Rights movement
and the ecological process of black suburbani-
zation do not represent causal connections but
are, nevertheless, highly suggestive of possible
relationships between broad political and so-
cial movements and the ecological structure of
metropolitan America. Simkus (1978) similarly
argues that the modest reductions in the segre-
gation of blacks and whites by occupational
group during the 1960s could be accounted for
by the changing societal race-relations climate.

Logan (1976; 1978) has argued that suburbs
are political ‘“‘actors” which have some degree
of control over how a suburb develops, i.e.,
political factors operate in conjunction with
and perhaps as a cause of ecological processes.
In fact, Logan (1978) argues that the spatial
distribution of population can be seen as an
outcome of political processes. In the present
case, suburbs appear to have the ability to ac-
celerate or retard the invasion—succession pro-
cess (ecological model most frequently used to
explain black change) by changing local growth
and development policies as dictated by the
larger societal trends.

The stability coefficients for suburban de-
velopment also changed substantially during
the past three decades. During the 1970s sig-
nificant changes in the rankings of suburbs
with respect to population size, area and job
concentration occurred. As smaller, higher-
status suburbs began to ‘age’ and undergo
status downgrading and growth slowdown,
eroding tax bases were bolstered by promoting
economic development and population growth.
This process is especially evident in an exami-
nation of the changes in the effects of status on
population, areal and job growth between the
1950s and 1960s and the 1970s. During the
1950s and 1960s suburban status was negatively
related to job growth and had weak or no effect
on population growth. During the 1970s subur-
ban status became positively related to both
population and job growth. This 1970s pat-
tern is consistent with Logan’s (1976; 1978)
argument that high-status suburbs solidify their
comparative advantage in relation to other
suburbs by promoting local industrial/business
development (usually accompanied by popula-
tion growth). By fueling population growth
with employment expansion, these formerly
small high-status suburbs may have begun to
lose their ability to control their population
composition by becoming too large and by
having an increasing multiplicity of community
interest groups that began to influence deci-
sions concerning local land use. Because of
increasing scale, furthermore, a few realtors no
longer could control the entire suburban hous-
ing market. As a result, blacks began to filter
into these areas as restrictions on land use
were relaxed and as job opportunities began to
increase (consistent with the positive effect of
status on black growth). It appears that some
higher-status suburbs that previously had
“token” black populations were experiencing
black growth as an unanticipated by-product of
these suburbs’ attempts to maintain their ad-
vantageous position vis-a-vis other suburbs
through local job expansion and population
growth.

In addition, during the 1970s, suburbs with
large black population began to grow in popu-
lation size, area and job concentration. The
overall population growth of black suburbs is
probably due to an increase in the volume of
black suburbanization, while job expansion is
probably due to the spillover or deflection of
less desirable activities from other white,
higher-status suburbs. Despite the continua-
tion of the general practice of exclusionism and
the prospect of continued segregation of blacks
in the fringe, the positive effects of percent
black on development and the emergence of a
positive effect of status on black growth indi-
cate that economic conditions in black suburbs
will improve; population growth and job
growth usually result in status upgrading (e.g.
Guest, 1978).
. Status is measured as the percent of the suburban
population with 12 or more years of formal edu-'
cation in 1950. Data were obtained from the Cen-
sus of Population. X = 43.35, S.D. = 2.55.

. Area is measured as the number of square miles.
Data were taken from County and City Data
Books. X = 8.09, S.D. = 7.87 (1950); X = 8.13,
S.D. =_8.85 (1960); X = 10.19, S.D. = 13.76
(1970); X = 11.68, S.D. = 20.09 (1980).

. Population size is taken from the Census of
Population. X = 20,073.49, S.D. = 19854.97
(1950); X = 27258.24, S.D. = 20369.55 (1960); xX
= 33413.61, S.D. = 24475.13 (1970); X =
36878.46, S.D. = 54903.99 (1980).

. Jobs is measured by the employment/residence
ratio which is the ratio of the number of jobs in
retailing, wholesaling, manufacturing and ser-
vices in a suburb divided by the number of local
residents who are employed in the same occu-
pations. The data are taken from the Municipal
Yearbooks and the 1980 Census of Population. X
= 83.01, S.D. = 100.23 (1954); X = 89.99, S.D. =
79.93 (1958); X = 90.77, S.D. = 70.48 (1967); X =
98.16, S.D. = 48.12 (1977).

. Black is the suburban percent black. Taken
from the Census of Population. X = 4.02,
S.D. =_8.10 (1950); X = 4.21, S.D. = 9.10
(1960); X = 4.79, S.D. = 10.37 (1970); X =
7.20, S.D. = 14.29 (1980).
