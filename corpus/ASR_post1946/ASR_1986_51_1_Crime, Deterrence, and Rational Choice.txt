This study examines the deterrent effect of formal sanctions on criminal behavior.
While most research on deterrence assumes a rational-choice model of criminal
decision-making, few studies consider all of the major elements of the model. In
particular, three critical limitations characterize the empirical literature on
deterrence: the failure to establish a causal ordering of sanctions and crime
consistent with their temporal ordering; the focus on conventional populations and
nonserious criminal acts, which are of less interest to the question of how society
controls its members; and the inattention to the return or reward component of the
decision-making process. To address these issues, we specify, estimate, and test a
rational-choice model of crime on data that were collected on individuals, gathered
within a longitudinal design, and derived from three distinct populations of persons
at high risk of formal sanction. The results support the reward component of the
rational-choice model, but fail to support the cost or deterrent component, as
measured by perceived risks of formal sanctions.
and punishment, and finally a subsequent spate
of empirical studies.

Unfortunately, despite numerous calls for a
general theory of deterrence, nearly all of the
empirical research on the issue takes as its
framework “a vague congery of ideas with no
unifying factor other than their being legacies
of two major figures in moral philosophy, Ces-
are Beccaria and Jeremy Bentham” (Gibbs,
1975:5). This is partly due to the practical con-
cerns of criminologists: since much of the
American criminal justice system is based di-
rectly or indirectly on ideas of Beccaria and
Bentham, the testing of those ideas has im-
mediate implications for public policy. As a
consequence, deterrence research has been
predominantly concerned with the isolated ef-
fects of the severity and certainty of sanctions
on illegal behavior. A more fruitful approach to
the issue of deterrence would examine the re-
lationship between formal sanctions and crime
from within an explicit theoretical framework.

This study examines the deterrence hypoth-
esis from within the rational-choice model,
a theoretical perspective proposed by
economists that not only provides a general
explanation of criminal behavior, but also
stipulates a specific mechanism by which for-
mal sanctions deter. Consider the following
formal statement of an actor's expected utility
under conditions of risk:
According to the statement, if for a given per-
son, the expected utility of an illegal (legal) act
is greater than the expected utility of other
alternatives, the person will engage in the il-
legal (legal) act. This behavioral model, which
is detailed by Friedman and Savage (1948),
Becker (1968), and Block and Heineke (1975)
identifies three requisites of a model explaining
the decision to engage in crime: it must include
the expected rewards from alternative courses
of legal or illegal action; it must consider the
expected costs of these actions; and it must
consider those expectations as subjectively
perceived by the actor, not as objectively in-
hering in the actions.

Empirical research on the importance of de-
terrence in eliciting conformity has employed
one of two strategies. The first, favored by
economists, entails macro-level analyses of the
relationship between aggregate crime rates and
aggregate rates of criminal justice actions such
as arrest, conviction, and imprisonment. The
second, favored by sociologists and social psy-
chologists, entails micro-level analyses of the
relationship between the criminal acts of indi-
viduals and their perceptions of the risks of
those acts. Such studies, whether micro-level
or macro-level, have been hampered by at
least four conceptual and methodological
shortcomings. First, macro-level analyses have
ignored the central role of perceptions in
rational-choice models. Second, micro-level
analyses have analyzed only restricted popula-
tions of conventional persons and nonserious
crimes, ignoring more threatening acts that are
central to the question of how society controls
the behavior of its members. Third, most re-
search has relied on cross-sectional research
designs, making causal inferences question-
able. Fourth, the statistical models of most
studies have omitted important variables—not
only control variables, but also variables rep-
resenting the reward or return component of
rational-choice models.

The research reported here seeks to over-
come these problems. Based on a two-wave
panel study of three independent samples, it
examines how persons’ perceptions of the
costs and rewards of legal and illegal behavior
are related to subsequent criminal activity. It
considers the impact of perceived returns from
crime, as well as perceived opportunities to
commit crime—two crucial elements of the
rational-choice model of crime ignored in pre-
vious research. The longitudinal design allows
us to specify a causal ordering among our vari-
ables that coincides with the temporal ordering
of their measurement. Our analytical strategy,
in addition, allows us to estimate and statisti.
cally control for measurement error in our in-
dicators of perceived threat of formal sanc-
tions. Furthermore, the three populations that
we sample consist of persons having a high
probability of engaging in serious, patterned
forms of crime, precisely those persons that
previous research concludes will be deterred
by threats of sanctions. Finally, the breadth of
the dataset allows us to include a variety of
exogenous background characteristics in our
causal models, thereby reducing the potential
bias from specification errors.

The remainder of this article is divided into
five sections. In the first, we critically review
previous individual-level research on the deter-
rence hypothesis, highlighting various meth-
odological problems.! In the second section we
describe our research design, sample, and per-
tinent variables, and present our structural
equation models. Section three presents our
analyses of measurement models of perceived
risk, while section four specifies, estimates,
and tests our model of rational choice and
crime. The final section concludes with a dis-
cussion of the theoretical implications of our
results.
Students of deterrence have long recognized
the problem of inferring causality from cross-
sectional research designs (Burkett and Jen-
sen, 1975; Logan, 1975; Jensen et al., 1978).
This is particularly problematic for indi-
vidual-level studies of deterrence for two
reasons. First, the causal ordering specified
among independent and dependent variables
contradicts their temporal ordering in the
sense that unlawful acts committed prior to an
interview are specified as a function of atti-
tudes measured during the interview. This de-
sign cannot rule out the possibility that any
observed negative relationship is due to the
impact of crime on perceived risks. Second,
because data on independent and dependent
variables are obtained from respondents in the
course of one interview, contamination effects
also cannot be ruled out. For example, individ-
uals’ reports on one set of variables may influ-
ence reports on another.

Some researchers have justified their cross-
sectional designs by assuming that perceptions
of risk remain stable over time, which would
make the timing of their measurement inconse-
quential (Silberman, 1976; Anderson et al.,
1977). Others have tried to resolve the problem
of changing the time frame to which their mea-
sures refer. For example, several have used as
their dependent variable, respondents’ esti-
mates of their future illegal behavior (Tittle,
1977, 1980; Grasmick and Green, 1980; and
Jensen and Stitt, 1982). Teevan (1976), on the
other hand, used a different independent vari-
able, asking respondents to recall their percep-
tions of risk prior to engaging in the deviant
acts they report. The approach of the first
group must be rejected since they assume away
what is in fact an empirical problem. The pro-
posed solutions of the other groups are prob-
lematic because at minimum they fail to deal
with contamination effects.

A more effective way of attacking this
issue—but by no means a panacea for the
problem (cf. Kessler and Greenberg, 1981)—
draws on a longitudinal research design. In-
deed, investigators have recently capitalized
on such designs with good success (Paternoster
Many social scientists have correctly noted
that to make causal inferences from nonex-
perimental data, one must have a correctly-
specified statistical model. This implies, in
particular, that all important nonorthogonal
explanatory variables are included in one’s
model; otherwise, estimates of important pa-
rameters may be biased and inconsistent.
Viewed in this light, individual-based research
on deterrence appears wanting. Most analyses,
in fact, are based in large part on bivariate
relationships (Waldo and Chiricos, 1972;
Teevan, 1976; Kraut, 1976; Erickson et al.,
1977; Saltzman et al., 1982; Paternoster et al.,
1982; Minor and Harry, 1982). Other analyses
include in their models elements of normative
controls or informal sanctions, such as deviant
associates, moral attachment, criminal mo-
tives, and the like (Silberman, 1976; Grasmick
and Green, 1980; Meier and Johnson, 1977;
Tittle, 1977, 1980; Paternoster et al., 1983).
With the possible exception of Tittle (1977,
1980), however, none of these studies include
in their models the reward, returns, and op-
portunity component so crucial to rational-
choice models (Heineke, 1978). As we noted
earlier, this is the other side of the two-sided
rational-choice model, the first being the risks
and costs of crime. Because perceptions of risk
may be correlated with perceptions of the re-
ward, returns, and opportunity for crime,
omitting the reward side may have led to
Students of deterrence are often less interested
in the social psychological process by which
any sanctions are related to any form of be-
havior, and more interested in the implications
of their research for the general problem of
social order—that is, how society controls the
behavior of its members (Silberman, 1976;
Meier and Johnson, 1977; Tittle, 1977, 1980).
However, most individual-level studies of de-
terrence have either sampled geographically-
defined general populations (Meier and
Johnson, 1977; Grasmick and Green, 1980;
Tittle, 1977, 1980) or sampled students in high
schools or colleges (Chiricos and Waldo, 1970;
Kraut, 1976; Teevan, 1976; Bailey and Lott,
1976; Silberman, 1976; Erickson et al., 1977;
Jensen et al., 1978; Minor and Harry, 1982;
Paternoster et al., 1983). Consequently, be-
cause serious crimes are a rare event in such
populations, researchers have used as depen-
dent variables nonserious forms of deviance,
such as petty theft, drunkeness, and marijuana
use. These behaviors pose a threat to the
values of some groups, but not others; there-
fore, the results of these studies may be more
relevant to the problem of informal controls by
specific groups. Of more importance to the
larger issues of social control by society in
general is the question, ‘“‘Why do some people
refrain from armed robberies, assaults, and
burglaries—behaviors that threaten all groups
in society—while others do not?” Stated an-
other way, deterrence may be more relevant to
serious forms of mala en se offenses (crimes
proscribed by both law and public mores) and
less relevant to trivial forms of mala prohibita
offenses (crimes proscribed by law but not by
public mores) (Gibbs, 1968, 1975; Silberman,
1976).

Potentially serious offenders are of particu-
lar interest to the study of deterrence for an-
other substantive reason. Two previous studies
The data for the present study pertain to both
captured serious criminal acts and actors.
Collected between 1975 and 1979 in the course
of evaluating the National Supported Work
Demonstration—a job-creation program for
persons with severe employment problems—
the data were obtained from three distinct
samples: adult offenders who previously had
been incarcerated; adults who were known
drug users; and adolescents age 17 to 20 who
had dropped out of school. Supported Work
was evaluated using data from nine different
communities throughout the United States.¢ In
general, to be eligible for Supported Work,
persons had to show they were recently and
chronically unemployed. Beyond that, Sup-
ported Work required that, in the previous six
months, participants in the offender sample
had spent time in jail or prison, those in the
addict sample had been enrolled in a drug
treatment program, and members of the youth
sample had been out of school. In addition, at
least half of the youth sample had to have an
arrest record.

These criteria notwithstanding, there was no
assurance of systematic recruitment into the
program across locales. Rather, in large part,
enrollment reflected the diverse and unknown
referral practices of workers in local social ser-
vice agencies. Consequently, we do not know
the precise relationship of our three samples to
larger populations of substantive interest, such
as all ex-offenders, addicts, or dropouts in the
United States. Therefore, while our samples
appear to capture serious offenders, and thus
have a decided advantage over those of previ-
5 This issue of external validity is substantive: our
results cannot be generalized if the cognitive pro-
cesses of serious offenders in the Supported Work
samples differ from their counterparts in the general
population. We find this very unlikely. Participants
in the Supported Work Program were selected
through the sometimes haphazard and idiosyncratic
procedures of numerous and widely-dispersed agents
within a variety of organizations. That this disparate
group of agents selected persons with uniform cog-
nitive styles that differ substantially from other of-
fenders, addicts, and dropouts seems improb-
able. We should also note that problems of sam-
ple selection and external validity are more severe in
most previous individual-level research. Such
studies typically drew samples from a single school
or community.

® Ina series of separate analyses conducted for the
program evaluation, Brown (1979) attempted to de-
termine whether sample attrition was systematic,
and if so, whether it biased estimates of the effects of
certain background variables on criminal behavior.
In the first analysis, he found that only race influ-
enced attrition: blacks in all three samples were less
likely than whites and Hispanics to drop out of the
program. In the second analysis, using Heckman’s
(1976) procedure for estimating and correcting for
sample selection bias, he found no biasing effects on
selected program outcomes, including self-reported
arrest. Furthermore, we initially attempted to use
data from all three waves, but could not because of
severe and systematic missing data. Most signifi-
cantly, persons who were incarcerated at the time of
their follow-up interviews were not asked several
key questions about their perceived risks of sanc-
tions. Therefore, we were forced to restrict the
analyses to the first two waves.
plausible picture of serious criminal offenders,
drug addicts, and adolescent school dropouts.”

During the first-wave interviews, measures
were obtained of key theoretical variables, in-
cluding respondents’ perceptions of their op-
portunities for, returns from, and evaluations
of both legal and illegal activities. The specific
questions dealt with five concepts: (1) respon-
dents’ estimates of the lowest pay they would
accept from a “straight” (legal) job (MINI-
MUM PAY); (2) their belief that they could
make more money “on the street” (illegally)
than from a straight job (RELATIVE EARN-
ING); (3) their belief that they had frequent
opportunities to engage in crime (CRIME OP-
PORTUNITY); (4) their relative respect for a
range of conventional versus illegal jobs (JOB
RESPECT); (5) their estimates of the proba-
bility they would be sanctioned negatively after
engaging in a $1000 crime. At the second-wave
interviews, we also measured whether respon-
dents had become involved in criminal activi-
ties, using two dichotomous indicators: self-
reports of crime and self-reports of arrest. The
self-report measure of crime was constructed
from checklists of a variety of serious of-
fenses.* (Descriptions of all observable vari-
ables appear in the Appendix.)

members painted by our background variables:
most respondents perceive limited prospects
for legal employment, report having been
actively involved in crime, and admit having
substantial contact with the criminal justice
system. The mean minimum wage that respon-
dents would accept from a legitimate job is
about what they could receive from Supported
Work; for most, however, this estimate is less
than the wage they believe could be earned
illegally. Half of them perceived frequent (daily
or weekly) opportunities for generating such
illegal income. Finally, between 20 percent and
30 percent of each sample reported either vio-
lating the law or being arrested in the nine
months between waves. In all three samples,
some respondents who reported being arrested
failed to admit to a crime, a pattern strongest in
the offender sample, leading to the unusual
finding that more offenders reported an arrest
than reported a crime.
We examined two competing specifications
of perceived risk: one in which our seven indi-
cators (see Appendix) are generated by a single
risk construct; and another in which the risk of
four events culminating in imprisonment (being
seen, reported, arrested, and incarcerated),
plus the risk of losing a job, reflect a formal risk
construct, while fear of losing a spouse or los-
ing friends (if imprisoned) reflect a personal
risk construct (see Figure 1). The latter con-
struct resembles, in some respects, the vari-
able, “‘personal disapproval,” which is firmly
established in the deterrence literature (cf.
Kraut, 1976; Grasmick and Green, 1980;
Paternoster et al., 1983). A test of these two
nested models, which amounts to whether or
not the correlation between the formal and per-
sonal risk factors is unity, supports the two-
factor model in all three samples.

Standardized parameter estimates of our
two-factor measurement model appear in Table
2. Validity coefficients (standardized loadings)
suggest that the measures are reasonably reli-
able indicators of their constructs for all three
samples. The risks of being reported and ar-
rested, in particular, are very reliable indica-
tors of persons’ perceptions of the risk of for-
mal sanctions. The correlations between fac-
tors support the discriminant validity of the
two factors: while nontrivial in size, the coeffi-
cients are far from unity. We expected the
measurement error of “risk of imprisonment
(given arrest)” to correlate positively with the
measurement error of ‘“‘risk of job loss (given
arrest).”!° As indicated in Table 2, our expec-
tations were confirmed.
Although the overall goodness-of-fit test fails
to support the model in addict and offender
samples, and provides only marginal support
for the youth sample, we believe it represents
the data adequately. An inductive search for
additional significant measurement error cor-
relations found few that could be replicated
across samples; moreover, of those that could,
each was trivial in size. Even though we could
improve the fit of the model by including such
correlations, our overall results remain un-
changed, and we feel such a model would
capitalize on chance by “‘over-fitting”’ the data.
It appears that we have sufficient statistical
power to detect trivial and substantively unim-
portant measurement error correlations (cf.
Saris and Stronkhorst, 1984; Matsueda and
Bielby, in Press)."!

We also examined the hypothesis that self-
reports of crime and arrest reflect a single
criminal activity construct, rather than sepa-
rate phenomena. The results strongly indicate
that the two measures tap distinct events:
when specified in a factor model, their re-
liabilities are unacceptably low and when en-
tered as outcomes in regression models, the
regressions are far from homogeneous.
Therefore, we treat them as separate outcome
variables and report both results. !?
(see Manski, 1978), some research on the use of the
self-report method have questioned its use under
certain circumstances. In particular Hindelang et al.
(1981), in perhaps the best research on the issue,
found that while self-reports appeared reasonably
valid and reliable by conventional standards, they
may be problematic for use on black males who have
had official contact with the criminal justice system.
These are not only among the most serious offend-
ers, but they also constitute a major portion of our
samples. Hindelang et al. based their conclusions on
their reverse record checks: black males with an
official record were significantly less likely to report
having committed an illegal act. To address this issue
a reverse record check for reported arrests was per-
formed on a subsample of the offenders and addicts
of the present study (Schore et al., 1979). That check
found substantial underreporting of the frequency of
arrests (45%) but less of prevalence of arrests (20%).
Moreover, the only variable related to underreport-
ing was race: blacks were more likely to underreport.
Since blacks tend to perceive lower risks of sanc-
tions than whites, the underreporting could attenuate
the effect of risk on crime. To investigate this possi-
bility, we followed the recommendation of Hin-
delang et al. and ran separate models for blacks and
whites. Our results found no differences in the effect
of risk on crime. This finding is consistent with Hin-
delang et al.’s suggestion that because validity coef-
ficients for self-reported delinquency are of similar
magnitude for blacks and whites, self reports may be
valid for assessing relationships within race, but in-
valid for assessing differences in behavior across
race.

crime, are each functions of the background
variables, and are not causally interrelated
among themselves, but instead are left as un-
analyzed correlations by allowing their
structural disturbances (u,—us) to correlate.
The outcome variables—self-reported crime
and arrest—are determined by the background
variables plus the intervening variables.
Table 3 presents the direction of effects hy-
pothesized by the model; the important hy-
potheses, derived from the rational choice
model, involve the effect of our endogenous
predictors on criminal activity and appear in
the last column. Focusing on these effects, we
expect that perceptions of higher risks of for-
mal (FORMAL RISK) and personal sanctions
(PERSONAL RISK) will reduce the likelihood
of crime. Also according to the model, persons
who feel they can earn more money illegally
than legally (RELATIVE EARNINGS) should
be more likely to succumb to criminal tempta-
tions. Similarly, persons who perceive more
opportunities (CRIME OPPORTUNITY) for
crimes should have greater objective opportu-
nities and lower opportunity costs for engaging
in crimes—both of which should increase their
chances of illegal activity. Finally, persons
holding more respect for legal jobs relative to
illegal forms of work (JOB RESPECT) should
have less taste for crime, greater moral inhibi-
tions, and therefore be less likely to violate the
law. Conflicting mechanisms make the direc-
tion of the impact of MINIMUM PAY on crime

two columns describe the equations of sub-
stantive interest—self-reported crime and ar-
rest. Across all three samples, the model ex-
plains self-reported crime better than arrest:
more of the variance is explained and more of
the coefficients are consistent with expecta-
tions. This suggests that the self-reported
crime construct is a more valid indicator of
illegal behavior (Mallar and Piliavin, 1984). We
therefore emphasize the results for self-
reported crime.

Of the background variables, the effects of
SEX, PRIOR MONETARY CRIME and
PRIOR ARRESTS are substantial and consis-
tent across all three samples. As expected
then, males, persons who have committed a
monetary crime in the past, and persons who
have been arrested more often, are all more
likely to violate the law. Also as expected, drug
users are more likely to violate the law in the
offender and youth samples; but because of
insufficient variance, this is not replicated in
the addict sample. Finally, LAST YEAR’S
MONETARY CRIMES has a significant posi-
tive effect on crime in offender and addict
samples, but not in youth samples.

Of more importance for the purpose of this
article is the impact on crime of the endogen-
ous predictors representing the rational-choice
process. Here, the most dramatic finding is
that across all samples and for both measures
of illegal activity, both formal and personal
risks of punishment have virtually no impact
on criminal behavior. This finding is all the
more compelling since we have attempted to
correct for attenuation due to unreliability in
our perceptual indicators of risk. Furthermore,
our equations predicting FORMAL RISK ex-
plain a nontrivial amount of variance (about ten
percent), and moreover, contain parameter es-
timates that coincide with our hypotheses. Our
equations for PERSONAL RISK explain less
variance (about seven percent), but do contain
coefficients consistent with expectations.
Therefore, we do not find evidence directly
questioning the (criterion) validity of our risk
constructs. Instead, we find that in contrast to
previous research, which concludes that deter-
rence should be more effective in less con-
ventional samples, in our samples containing
criminally-motivated and morally-uncom-
mitted persons, perceptions of the risk of
formal and personal sanctions fail to make a
difference in explaining crimes.

What does appear to make a difference is the
other side of the rational-choice process—the
Opportunity or returns component. Specifi-
cally, CRIME OPPORTUNITY has a substan-
tial and statistically significant effect on illegal
behavior across all three samples. As ex-
pected, persons who perceive greater opportu-
nities to earn money illegally are more likely to
violate the law. Furthermore, in offender and
addict samples, persons who hold more respect
for illegitimate occupations relative to legiti-
mate jobs (JOB RESPECT) have more to gain
and less to lose by violating the law and there-
fore are significantly more likely to do so.
The variables representing the returns com-
ponent of the rational choice process mediate
the impact on crime of some of our background
variables. For offender and addict samples,
persons who are younger and who have com-
mitted monetary crimes in the last year commit
more crimes in part because they perceive
greater opportunities and return to crime. In
the youth sample, this mechanism holds for
persons who have used drugs and who have
been arrested. Overall, however, our block of
endogenous variables mediates little of the total
effects of our exogenous variables. Further-
more, across all three samples, the increase in
explained variance is marginal at best.'4
Could our finding that formal and personal
risks fail to deter stem from a methodological
artifact? We explored several possibilities. It
could be that risks of formal and personal
sanctions deter monetary crimes but not other
crimes; in fact, this is consistent with some
variants of the rational-choice explanation. To
test this, we estimated our model using as an
outcome variable, self-reports of committing a
property crime in the previous nine months.
With trivial exceptions, the parameter esti-
mates of this model mirrored those of our ear-
lier models. This result is not surprising since
the percentage of persons reporting any crime
who also report a monetary crime ranges from
77 percent (addicts) to 86 percent (offenders).
A second possible artifact involves the func-
tional form of the relationship between sanc-
tions and crime. Some researchers have pos-
tulated and found nonlinear effects due to di-
minishing returns (Logan, 1972) or threshold
effects (Tittle and Rowe, 1974; Tittle, 1980).
According to this hypothesis, sanctions will
not deter until the perceived probability of risk
reaches a certain threshold; conversely, the
deterrent effect of sanctions may diminish
when the perceived probability of risk reaches
a point of saturation. If true, our linear proba-
bility model may have underestimated the
slope of the risk variables at moderate levels of
risk. To examine this hypothesis, we estimated
multivariate logistic regressions on our
single-indicator variables plus factor scores of
our multiple-indicator risk variables.'* Again,
for all three samples and for both self-reported
crime and arrest, the results remain relatively
unchanged.

Still, it could be that because the true
threshold is so high, extremely high levels of
perceived risk are required before sanctions
deter, and consequently, the logistic functional
form is unable to capture the true nonlinear
relationship between sanctions and crime. We
therefore estimated an extreme model, postu-
lating that persons are not deterred until they
perceive the greatest possible risk on every
component of the risk construct. We con-
structed two dichotomous risk variables,
which contrasted persons who scored highest
on every indicator of FORMAL and PER-
SONAL RISK versus all others, and entered
them into our full multivariate logit model.
Again, however, the parameter estimates re-
tained the sign and statistical significance of
those of our LISREL models.

Finally, it could be that the nonlinear deter-
rent effect can be captured by specifying a
conditional effect. That is, because the word-
ing of our indicators of PERSONAL RISK re-
quires that respondents hypothetically con-
sider they have been imprisoned, it follows that
PERSONAL RISK might deter only those who
consider incarceration a likely result of crime.
To test this hypothesis, we estimated the
model separately for two groups: those having
high scores on FORMAL RISK versus all
others. Again, however, PERSONAL RISK
failed to affect crime significantly in either
group.
sions remain unchanged: we find evidence
supporting the opportunity and reward compo-
nent of the rational-choice model of crime, but
no evidence supporting the risk component.
The null finding regarding perceived risks is
consistent with findings of other individual-
level studies of deterrence that have used less
rigorous designs and analytical procedures. We
have gone beyond previous research not
only analytically, but also by extending
those results to a different and significant
population—namely, the population of serious
and high risk offenders. Moreover, our results
explicitly refute the hypothesis, proposed by
Silberman (1976) and Tittle (1977, 1980), that
the threat of legal punishment deters persons
who are less committed to conventional
morality. Furthermore, taken together with our
positive results regarding opportunities and
returns, these null findings suggest that the
rational-choice model may oversimplify the
cognitive process behind criminality. What
may be needed is a more complex model that
relaxes some of the stringent assumptions of
the strict rational-choice approach.

For example, a greater emphasis on the lim-
itations of human beings to acquire and process
information, such as the probability of sanc-
tions, may be warranted (cf. Simon, 1957).
That is, it may be that people are insensitive to
marginal changes in their perceptions of the
probabilities of the consequences (sanctions)
of their actions, especially when that proba-
bility is low (Kunreuther and Slovic, 1978).
Instead, they may alter their behavior only
after major discontinuous shifts in their per-
ceptions of the risk of sanctions. Moreover,
persons may discount the meaning or rele-
vance of certain probabilities: when confronted
with a decision, they may discount some out-
comes relative to others of equal probability
(Kahnemann and Tversky, 1984). For exam-
ple, persons may slight those consequences or
events that are either distant or beyond their
direct control, and emphasize those that are
immediate and within control (Kogan and
Wallach, 1967; Ainslie, 1982). Furthermore,
the particular style of discounting—empha-
sizing some options but not others—probably
varies from one person to another.

We are suggesting that persons’ evaluations
or imputed meanings of sanctions are impor-
tant in determining their behavior. These
evaluations or meanings may be conditioned
by elements within the immediate situation
confronting the individual. For example, the
persons’ perceptions of the opportunity, re-
turns, and support for crime within a given
situation may influence their perceptions of
risks and the extent to which those risks are
discounted. This implies that the effective
assessments of risk are to some extent
situationally-induced, transitory, and unstable
(Short and Strodtbeck, 1965). If true, this could
help explain the ineffectiveness of our risk
variables—that is, if persons’ perceptions of
risk are unstable over time, and the causally-
relevant perceptions are those more proximate
to crime, our distal measures of perceived risk
may be irrelevant to behavior.

We can provide some indirect evidence on
the last hypothesis by examining a model of the
stability of our risk constructs. This model,
depicted in Figure 3, is a two-wave panel ver-
sion of our multiple-indicator measurement
model. The model specifies that the FORMAL
(PERSONAL) RISK construct at time two is a
linear function of FORMAL (PERSONAL)
RISK at time one and self-reported CRIME
and ARREST measured at time two. Intertem-
poral correlations of response errors for each
indicator are estimated to disentangle true sta-
bility from response effects that remain con-
stant over time. The standardized coefficients,
given in Table 7, indicate that both FORMAL
and PERSONAL RISK are relatively unstable
over time. For offender and youth samples,
self-reported crime affects both FORMAL and
PERSONAL RISK significantly, a result con-
sistent with the findings by Saltzman et al.
(1982) and Minor and Harry (1982) of ‘‘exper-
iential’ effects. A very small component of the
total stability in perceived risk, then, works
indirectly through criminal behavior.

These results suggest that persons did
change their perceptions of risk substantially
over the nine months between waves, and that
this change was only modestly affected by
crime. Therefore, we cannot rule out the pos-
sibility that in our sample, persons’ perceptions
of risks more proximate to their decision to
engage in or refrain from crime do influence the
outcome of that decision.

This issue and others raised above can be
examined, at least in part, by research
capitalizing on multiwave panel data. By col-
lecting waves of data spaced closer in time, a
more fine-grained temporal analysis is possi-
ble, capturing changes in perceptions of risk
and the impact of those changes on criminal
behavior. Furthermore, such a strategy would
allow one to disentangle within-individual
changes in attitudes, perceptions, and
behaviors from within-time variation in such
variables.
