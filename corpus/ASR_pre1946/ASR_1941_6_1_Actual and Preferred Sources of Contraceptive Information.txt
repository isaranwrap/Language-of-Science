2T.e., every 100 contraceptors obtained information from 116 sources on the average.
these two sources also raises some interesting questions. Are technical con-
traceptive problems discussed in conversations under the intimate cover of
friendship? Or is this “grapevine” tending to wither in the face of growing
social objectivity in regard to birth control, thus leading seekers for infor-
mation to more scientific sources? Is the family continuing to perpetuate its
traditional pattern of reproductive behavior through the influence which
mothers have over their daughters?

Obviously, these are questions which cannot be answered categorically,
but the data offer some clues. The material was tabulated to indicate how
long ago the information was obtained (Table 2). The minor sources are

1 These dates include both the years named.

2 More detailed figures for clinics, although they might logically be expected to be sub-
stantiated by a wider sampling, are not reliable within the limits of the present data. These
percentages for five-year periods are: before 1919, not available; 1919-1924, 1.0; 1925-1929,
1.43 1930-1934, 1-93 1935-1939, 2.3.

 

combined in this table into two groups: (1) formal, or “institutionalized,”
sources including clinics, visiting nurses, priests, ministers, rabbis, schools,
and lectures; and (2) informal (largely commercial) sources including drug-
gists, books, pamphlets, magazine articles, and advertisements.

Table 2 warrants the following conclusions (for this sample).

1. The doctors of the country are playing an increasingly important role
in supplying their patients with contraceptive information.

2. There has been a very pronounced decline in the tendency of the
family to perpetuate its reproductive pattern of behavior independently of
other agencies, as indicated by an increasing hesitancy on the part of
daughters to rely upon their mothers and relatives for contraceptive infor-
mation. This marked trend would appear to be consistent with other func-
tional changes which are taking place within the family.
SOURCES OF CONTRACEPTIVE INFORMATION 35

3- Reliance upon friends as a source of contraceptive information is
tending to decrease. This may indicate a decrease in prejudice toward birth
control as evidenced by wider discussion beyond the circle of friendship.

4. Birth control clinics, despite many legal and social obstacles, appear to
be reaching a larger (though still small) proportion of the population.

5. As clinics and commercial agencies extend their influence, other formal
agencies of information tend to play a constant role in the diffusion process.

6. Since 1935, women appear to be seeking fewer sources of contraceptive
information, as evidenced by the fact that on the average every 100 women

Religious counselor was preferred by 4 percent of the Catholics, and by less
than 0.5 percent of the Protestants and of the Jews.

In conclusion, it is interesting to note that, although 61 percent of the
respondents obtained information from doctors, clinics, and nurses, only
18 percent actually use a diaphragm.? Yet it is logical to assume that most
of those who use a diaphragm must have obtained it from one of these
three sources, since a diaphragm is supposed to be fitted. This discrepancy
may be due to one or more of three factors (although the data gave no idea
of the relative force of each factor): (1) doctors and clinics may not uni-
versally recommend diaphragm; (2) diaphragm is a relatively new method
and much of the information was obtained sometime ago; and (3) dia-
phragm may have been recommended but not permanently accepted by
the patient. This possibility raises the very important question of the
psychological and physiological acceptability of this method. This question
cannot be answered by the present data, but it merits further study.

2 No data were obtained on methods originally recommended, or methods employed im-
mediately after obtaining the information.
