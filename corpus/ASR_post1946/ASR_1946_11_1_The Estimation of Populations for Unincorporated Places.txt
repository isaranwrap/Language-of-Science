S SOCIOLOcISTS are well aware, there
A exists today a sizeable body of data
both on general and on specific as-
pects of village life and on the relationships
of village, town, and open country. As a
result of the pioneering efforts of such men
as Brunner, Galpin, Kolb, Landis, Sanderson,
Sims, Smith, Williams, Wilson, Zimmerman,
and their co-workers, the area of village fact
has continuously encroached upon the area
of speculation and opinion.

Despite the amassing of this considerable
information, the village-hamlet group as a
unit of population has received comparatively
little study. Population experts have tended
to be concerned with other and larger units,
the data for which have been more readily
available; and rural sociologists have not
ordinarily placed major emphasis on the
demographic aspects of rural centers.

A major reason for the existence of such a
condition is obviously to be found in the
inadequacy of existing data sources. The
deficiencies both of the federal census and
of the commercial atlases have already been
made known.’ Yet, aside from those studies
which have uncritically accepted atlas figures
or which have erred in considering the
census rural-nonfarm category as synony-
mous with villages, only meagre research
has been attempted in an effort to break
down the rural-nonfarm population into its
constituent elements.”

An interesting method of estimating the
populations of unincorporated villages from
the list of the number of business units in
each center provided by Dun and Brad-
street has, however, been developed by T.
Lynn Smith.’ Using data for 26 states, Smith
has summarized the relationship between
numbers of businesses and numbers of resi-
dents in the regression equation Y = 119.6
+ 20.9X, which may be read in this way:
on the average the addition of a single
business unit (X) will indicate an ac-
companying increase of 21 inhabitants (Y).
For incorporated villages the census popula-
tions and the number of business units were
checked for relationships. A coefficient of
correlation of r = + .834 was obtained
indicating that “the relationship is very close
and that a high degree of reliance can be
placed upon the estimates of population
based on a knowledge of the number of
business units.”

The assumption was then made that a
similar relationship exists in unincorporated
centers. If such an assumption is accepted,
then it would seem that the Bradstreet lists
of businesses operating in unincorporated
centers might be used in the calculation
of the size of the total village population
of a given territory,
As part of a broader field study carried
on by the author in 1940 and 1941 in a ten-
county subregion of north-central North
Carolina, an empirical check on such a
relationship was made. Although it is for a
limited area, it serves to indicate some of the
difficulties involved in estimating the popula-
tions of unincorporated centers from num-
bers of business units.
have expected, that within each category an
increase in population is accompanied by the
ability to support a greater mean number
of stores, Of greater concern for our pur-
pose, however, is the considerable difference
in the number of business units found in
centers of the same size class but of dif-
ferent functional types.® In size classes I, IT,
III, and IV, without exception, the agricul-
tural centers support a greater average num-
ber of business units than do the suburban
centers; and the suburban centers are in the
same relationship to the industrial centers.
In size class V, however, the industrial
villages support a greater mean number of
business units than does the single suburban
village of this size. Not only is this pattern
uniform, but as the population classes in-
crease, the differential between the agricul-
tural villages on the one hand and the sub-
urban and industrial villages on the other
becomes striking.

For the subregion, at least, the figures of
Table I must throw doubt upon the validity
of estimating the populations of individual
places from the number of business units.
Further, if we assume the method to be
accurate for agricultural villages, can it be
equally so for industrial villages when, for
example, agricultural villages of between 750
and 1,249 people are seen to support an
average of 46.8 business units as against
13.0 in industrial villages of the same size?

The method developed by Professor Smith
has been applied to the villages of the sub-

* The villages and hamlets of the subregion were
found to fall exclusively into three functional types:
agricultural, suburban, and industrial. Villages were
divided as well by size, five convenient and gen-
erally established intervals being used, two for
hamlets and three for villages. These were: Class I,
25-99 population; Class II, 100-249 population;
Class III, 250-749 population; Class IV, 750-1,249
population; and Class V, 1,250-2,499 population. See

region, and the populations obtained by its
use have been compared with those produced
by a house-to-house count made in the
field.6 For the 22 incorporated villages of
the subregion, the relationship between the
size of the population and the number of
business units was calculated. The resulting
regression equation was used in an attempt
to estimate the populations of the 45 un-
incorporated villages in the same area. The
accuracy of such estimations was checked by
population counts in the field.”

In the regression equation the number of
business units in a center was taken as the
independent variable or X and the number
of inhabitants as the dependent variable or
Y. For the subregion the relationships be-
tween the two variables is summarized in
the regression equation Y = 324 + 18.5X.
This may be interpreted as indicating on the
average an increase of nearly 19 persons for
each unit increase in the number of business
establishments, A coefficient of correlation of
r = + .801 (compared to Smith’s + .834
indicates a close relationship between the
two variables. We may examine in Table II
the exact amount of difference between pop-
ulations arrived at by estimation and by
actual count of dwelling units.

It will be seen at once that in only four
out of 45 cases is the difference in the two
population figures less than 50 and that in
only an additional four is this difference less
than roo. In 19 instances it lies between
too and 249; in 11, between 250 and 499;
and in 7, over 499. Actually, for one of the
villages (Industrial-V, Village 3), the dif-
ference in the two populations is more than
1,000; and in two others (Industrial-V,
Village 1 and Suburban-V, Village 1) it is
nearly as great. If we make our comparison
in terms of types of villages, we find that
among the agricultural centers 18 popula-
tions appear to be overestimated by using
the regression equation based on business
units; and the range of overestimation runs
as high as the over-499 interval for one
village, On the other hand, three agricultural
village populations, all in class V villages,
are apparently underestimated by this
method; the range of underestimation is
from the over-499 interval for one center to
the 250-499 interval for the remaining two.

When we turn to the industrial and subur-
ban villages, the picture is somewhat dif-
ferent. All but the smallest industrial and
suburban villages are underestimated, and
only for four industrial and for two sub-
urban villages, both in class III, is the error
less than 100, For the seven remaining
smaller industrial villages the error is be-
tween 100 and 249. All six of the industrial
villages in classes IV and V are underesti-
mated by at least 250 persons. The latter
is also true for two out of three of the
suburban villages in classes IV and V.

A further check on method was attempted
by use, for the entire State of North Caro-
lina, of Dun and Bradstreet commercial list-
ings and of census figures for the populations
of certain unincorporated centers.? Un-
fortunately, it was found that Dun and
Bradstreet listings occurred for only 11
unincorporated centers (three of them of
over 2,500 persons) for which census pop-
ulation estimates were also given. For the
single agricultural village in this group an
overestimation of 22 persons was obtained
by use of the regression equation. For the
remaining places (all industrial centers, one
in class IV, six in class V, and 3 above 2,500
population) underestimations ranging from
584 to 3,184 persons occurred.

Dun and Bradstreet listings did, however,
indicate a considerable variation in the num-
ber of business units found in villages approxi-
mately equal in population. And as in the sub-
region, a number of centers showed com-
mercial establishments disproportionate to
their population size. Leaksville, with a 1940
census population of 1,886, contains 141
business units with an additional five nearby.
Helton (population: 1,116) has only one
business unit, and McAdenville (population:
887) has only three with one additional
nearby. It is unfortunate that the data
available are insufficient to indicate whether
the total village population of the state
estimated by use of the regression equation
above would approximate correctness.
Certain conclusions now emerge. Primary
among these is the fact that, in the sub-
region at least, individual village populations
are not to be estimated from numbers of
business units alone. The type of village and
its location appear to be factors of equal
importance, The suburban place is in obvious
dependence upon the trade units of the
nearby city. The latter are extraterritorial
resources available to the suburban dweller
in a matter of a few minutes either in his
own car or, generally, over local bus routes.
The suburban village is likely to be more
diffused than the industrial or agricultural
village. It cannot support the larger or the
more specialized store to be found in the
nearby city, Neither can it offer a market
for the older type of general store still
characteristic of many agricultural centers.
Villagers prefer the city for most of the
articles they might be inclined to buy in a
general store in a more remote agricultural
village. And farmers do little shopping in
such centers. The larger city is only a few
minutes beyond. Likewise, the industrial
center for the most part lacks a trade hinter-
land. Farmers have not found extensive
cordiality extended to them in industrial
villages. Most often they feel themselves
tolerated rather than welcomed. Again,
industrial villages as a whole are significantly
closer to urban centers of 10,000 or more
population than are agricultural villages® so

° This is statistically demonstrated in The Pattern
that the competitive force of the city tends
to react upon them more nearly in the same
way it reacts upon the suburban village. In
sum, both suburban and industrial villages
tend to be under-stored because of these
restricting factors, while the very fact that
these same factors operate with lesser force
upon agricultural villages as a whole and
that these villages are the trade centers not
merely, nor even primarily, for their own
populations but for a rural trade of varying
size, tends to cause agricultural villages to be
overstored in relation to the number of their
inhabitants. Because this is true, a set pop-
ulation formula based on business units alone
will hardly suit all types of villages. And
even within a type, much would seem to
depend upon locational factors, distance from
a city, distance from competing villages, and
so on, The means of transportation and com-
munication available and the topographical
features of a local area are also important
in obvious ways.

The village of Goldston, whose population
is considerably overestimated by use of the
regression equation, is located in a relatively
remote part of the subregion. The largest
trade center in the county, a village of just
over 2,000 people, is more than 12 miles
away; and the nearest small urban place is
some 13 miles in another direction. It is al-
most 40 miles to the nearest city of 10,000
people and nearly 43 miles, in part over
dirt roads, to the nearest city of 50,000
people. Goldston is thus a trade center for
a relatively wide area and contains a far
greater number of business units than it
could possibly support given another and less
favorable location.

In the other direction, the agricultural
village which showed the greatest under-

mean distance of large agricultural and industrial
villages from the nearest urban place of 10,000 or
more people, for example, the observed difference
between the means is significant since, where t =

In the subregion, of course, no such generalization
to a hypothetical universe is involved since the
complete enumeration of villages has been made

estimation (1,362 against a census figure of
2,060) is Mebane, located on a principal
United States highway about ten miles from
a city of over 10,000 people and approaching
midway between two cities of over 50,000,
the nearer of which is 19.2 miles away.
Mebane too is large enough so that it is
something of a manufacturing village al-
though it remains primarily a service center
for a surrounding farm territory.

Of the villages for which the use of the
regression equation results in an overestima-
tion of more than 100 people, Creedmoor is
one of the most important mule markets in
the South; Wendell and Zebulon are promi-
nent tobacco markets; and Apex, Fuquay-
Varina, and Stoneville are farmers’ towns
somewhat similar to Goldston in their remo-
val from the immediate competition of larger
urban places.’° For the agricultural villages
with underestimates of more than 100 per-
sons, the situation is in general the reverse.
These centers are not prominent farmers’
villages and tend to be located in areas of
urban competition. For only one of these
villages, Siler City, does this explanation
seem not to hold and we must assume that
there are other factors, at present unkown,
which are operative. The rapid expansion
of this center over the last decade may have
outrun the normal increase in the number of
business units.

At this point it may be asked whether the
preponderance of underestimates for indus-
trial and suburban villages is due to a limita-
tion on the definition of what constitutes a
business unit so that many such units, as
defined by Dun and Bradstreet, are excluded
here. On the contrary, the definition of busi-
ness unit employed here has purposely been
of liberal bent. Every business found to exist

ume of the Federal Writers Project, North Carolina:

extreme.

In the light of this evidence, we must
conclude that whatever the situation else-
where, the method of basing population
estimates for villages on the number of trade
units therein is an inadequate one for the
estimation of the populations of individual
centers in the area surveyed. It is possible
that for a large number of villages over-
estimates and underestimates would tend to
cancel each other. But there is as yet no
proof of this; and, in fact, the evidence for
the subregion would fail to corroborate such
a contention, Certainly this would not be so
for any single functional type of rural center.
Use of the regression equation in estimating
the village population of the subregion
results in an underestimation of 3,055 people
out of a total village population of 36,875.

It cannot be too strongly urged that the
Bureau of the Census refine and extend its
techniques’? until a complete picture of the
elements of the rural-nonfarm population can
be presented on the basis of actual count.
Certainly it seems unlikely that any indepen-
dent scholar or foundation will be warranted
or able to undertake a task of such magni-
tude. Meanwhile, in the continuing search
for methods which will permit the more accu-
rate separation of the rural-nonfarm popula-
tion into its constituent elements, there is need
for a careful check on theory through the use
of empirical data if misconceptions of a kind
too prevalent in the past are to be avoided.
