In the twelve years since the publica-
tion of Floyd Hunter’s classic, Community
Power Structure, sociology and political
science have experienced a vigorous re-
vival of interest in community studies.
Certainly one of the major explanations
for this resurgence is to be found in the
fact that Hunter introduced a method that
promised wide application and a proce-
dure for the verification of particular re-
sults. Yet at the same time Hunter’s
method aroused considerable skepticism,
especially among political scientists, for
what was alleged to be a misplaced focus
on reputation rather than actual influence
and, perhaps as a result, an overly mo-
nopolistic description of the community
power structure. In these twelve years
the debate over the relative merits of
the (Hunter) reputational method, as op-
posed to the analysis of decision-making
processes, has been joined by numerous
scholars of various persuasions and shows
little sign of abatement.2 There is, how-
ever, one point on which researchers and
commentators are nearly unanimous: the
need for truly comparative studies.

The purpose of this paper is to review
a substantial portion of the existing liter-
ature on community power in order to
identify what generalizations, if any, can
be drawn concerning the methodological
and substantive correlates of various types
of community power structure. Once this
has been done we should be in a position
to suggest some guidelines for compara-
tive studies. Rossi, commenting on the
diversity of findings and persistent gaps
in our knowledge of the community, has
observed that “little progress has been
made in putting things together in a sys-
tematic way.’* This review is an attempt
to “put things together” in such a way.

A. Community Characteristics
The demographic and economic charac-
teristics in Table 1—region, population size
and composition, extent of industrialization
and economic base—are self-explanatory.
B. Method
Studies of community power have relied
on three distinct methods: the reputational,
the decision-making, and the case study. Ac-
tual use of these three usually involves some
variations which are more definitively en-
compassed with the following fivefold clas-
sification.
1. Reputational methods

a) Reputational—informants are asked
to identify the most influential peo-
ple in the community when it comes
to getting things done. Here leaders
are nominated directly in a one-step
procedure.

6) Reputational, two-step—informants
are given lists, assembled by various
means, of purportedly influential
leaders and asked to evaluate them
in terms of influence (usually by nar-
rowing the list or ranking its mem-
bers).

2. Positional methods

a) Positional—leaders are taken to be
those persons occupying important
positions in formal and/or informal
organizations.

b) Positional and Reputational—a com-
bination of 16 and 2a.

3. Decision-making approach (event or is-
sue analysis)

a) Decisions—the focus is on specific
community issues, and leaders are
those persons active or instrumental
in the resolution.

4. Case-study method

a) Case study—methods are less ex-
plicit; usually the community and
leadership are analyzed as a process.

5. Combined approaches

a) Combined—simultaneous use of the

above, especially 1 b and 3.
The organization of studies provided
in Table 1 enables us to test, at least on
the basis of a substantial portion of the
literature, a number of hypotheses that
have been advanced in more limited con-
texts. The nine hypotheses employ com-
munity power structure as the dependent
variable and are arranged under three
categories of independent variables. They
are derived from a number of sources with
occasional modification in order to keep
the list to a manageable size and to pro-
vide conceptual equivalence with the data.

A. Methodological Characteristics

1. The reputational method tends to iden-
tify pyramidal power structures, while
the decision-making approach discovers
factional and coalitional power struc-
tures.7

2. The two-step reputational method tends
to produce a pyramidal description of
power structure more frequently than the
direct-nomination procedure.8

logical Review, XXIV (December, 1959), 796-803.

° Thomas J. Anton, “Power, Pluralism and Local
Politics,” Administrative Science Quarterly, VII
(March, 1963), 425-57; Robert E. Agger, in
private correspondence. The converse to each of
these first three hypotheses, i.e., that “the reputa-
tional approach does not predetermine conclusions
in the way which critics suggest,” has recently been
put forth, See Baha Abu-Laban, “The Reputa-
tional Approach in the Study of Community
Power: A Critical Evaluation,” Pacific Sociologi-
cal Review, VIII (Spring, 1965), 35-42.

** Where, for purposes of statistical analysis, the
categories have been collapsed, pyramidal forms
one and factional, coalitional, and amorphous the
other,
firmed. The reputational method tends to
identify pyramidal structures while deci-
sion-making and combined methods re-
flect factional, coalitional, and amorphous
types.1 Further, when the reputational
method is used, either exclusively or in
combination with some other, the two-step
procedure indicates pyramidal structures.
Third, when non-governmental areas of in-
fluence are of chief concern, pyramidal
structures more frequently obtain than
when the focus is on governmental areas.17
Hypothesis A4 is rejected, comparative
studies showing no significant departure
from the results of single case studies.

Hypotheses B1 and B2 are not clearly
supported although the data in Table 3
show tendencies in that direction. A so-
cially integrated population may tend to
be associated with a less concentrated
power structure. Regional differences are
somewhat clearer with the northeast and
north central regions, reflecting less con-
centration of power than is found in the
South.

Although the levels of significance are
not striking, mere inspection of the data
on the economic variables provides some
support for hypotheses C1 and C2, al-
though in the case of C3 the data are in-
conclusive.18

* The coalitional and amorphous categories are combined because of frequent small
N’s in the latter and because both represent the absence of any concentration of power,
thereby satisfying the purposes of this analysis.

{ The N’s here and in the table that follows vary because the studies do not uniformly
provide data on each variable.

t The x? test is employed here with the recognition that the assumption of independent
cell frequencies is not fully met, since over half of the communities were investigated in
conjunction with at least one other. This consideration did not seem important enough to
dispense with an otherwise useful technique.

§ The N here is inflated because studies employing either the one-step or two-step repu-
tational method in combination with the decision-making approach are included in the
analysis.

implications for a parsimonious combination of
them are provided in the following: Robert O.

cal Review, LXIII (November, 1957), 290-96;

ington, XXV (June, 1957), 148-54; Linton C.
Freeman et al., “Metropolitan Decision Making,”

(Syracuse, N.Y.: Syracuse University, 1962); Ir-
win T. Sanders, “The Community Social Profile,”
American Sociological Review, XXV (February,
1960), 75-77; David A. Booth and Charles R.
Adrian, “Simplifying the Discovery of Elites,”

ber, 1961), 14-16; Bonjean, op. cit.; Presthus,
op. cit.; Agger et al., op. cit.; L. Vaughn Blanken-
ship, “Community Power and Decision Making:
A Comparative Evaluation of Measurement Tech-
niques,” Social Forces, XLIII (December, 1964),
207-16.
Specifically, comparative studies should
employ samples stratified with regard to
demographic and economic characteristics.
Considerably more attention should be
devoted to change, especially vis-a-vis
metropolitan development and larger gov-
ernmental units.2 An abbreviated combi-
nation of the reputational and decision-
making techniques needs to be developed
to guard against the type of bias we have
considered.”?

In summary, the absence of comparative
methods continues to be the major obstacle
to an adequate sociology of community
power. This review documents the need
for more attention to this problem.
