Let the welfare of Person be P and\\n that of Other be 0. Then if Person is purely co-operative, he maximizes P + 0; if purely competi-\\n tive, he maximizes P - 0; and if purely individualistic, he maximizes P alone. More generally, he maxi-\\n mizes P + aO, where a (altruism) normally ranges from 1.0 to -1.0. To assess a, Person either directly\\n estimates its value on a scale from 1.0 to -1.0 or ranks his preferences for various outcomes for him-\\n self and for Other. Both measures show that (1) three college groups all differentiate among friend,\\n stranger, and antagonist, (2) YMCA college students are generally more positively oriented toward the\\n other\\'s welfare-friend, stranger, or antagonist, (3) business students maximize their own reward more,\\n and (4) social science students differentiate most between friends and antagonists.\\n\\n The Altruism Scale assesses the value\\n one places upon the welfare of another in\\n relation to his own. This measure is in-\\n tended to correspond generally to con-\\n ceptualizations of altruism both from\\n psychology (\"affection and concern for\\n others\") and from sociology (\"where the\\n goal of conduct [of the ego] is exterior to\\n itself\"), as well as to more general defini-\\n tion (\"the principle or practice of seeking\\n the welfare of others\").2\\n\\n 1 The author is grateful to Norman Bradburn of\\n the University of Chicago Graduate School of Busi-\\n ness and to Clifford Holmes and Alex Shukin of\\n George Williams College for aid in obtaining\\n subjects; to Lawrence Carson, Brian Heller, and\\n Thomas Tyler for assistance in the analysis of the\\n data; to Peter Blau for comments on the manu-\\n script; and, particularly, to Morris Friedell for\\n insightful contributions to the conceptualization\\n as well as to later stages of this research.

Such a formulation, deriving from\\n and elaborating upon bargaining and game\\n theory, has proven highly provocative of\\n both conceptual and empirical analysis.5\\n\\n As conceived in this analysis, a person\\'s\\n selection among alternative actions de-\\n pends, to some degree, upon the resultant\\n welfare not only to himself but to the other\\n as well. Explicitly or implicitly, he places\\n a certain weight upon the other\\'s welfare\\n in relation to his own. Three particular\\n values of this weight are of special in-\\n terest, for they define the following promi-\\n nent orientations.\\n\\n Co-operation, individualism, and comn-\\n\\n petition.-Assume that Person is inter-\\n acting with Other in a situation in which\\n there are several possible outcomes, not all\\n equally favorable to both. Then, in arriv-\\n ing at a preference among these outcomes,\\n three prominent orientations that Person\\n can take are these: (1) He can prefer that\\n outcome in which the sum of his welfare\\n and that of Other is the greatest; (2) he\\n can simply prefer that outcome in which\\n his own welfare is the greatest, irrespec-\\n tive of Other\\'s; or (3) he can prefer that\\n outcome in which the relative advantage of\\n his welfare over Other\\'s is the greatest.\\n\\n 5See R.

If Person is acting purely co-opera-\\n tively, he maximizes P + 0; if acting\\n purely individualistically, he maximizes P\\n alone; and if acting purely competitively,\\n he maximizes P - 0. Examples of pure\\n co-operation, individualism, and competi-\\n tion occur in the interaction of (1) hus-\\n band and wife striving to augment family\\n income, (2) entrepreneurs each attempting\\n merely to maximize his own profit, and (3)\\n bureaucrats competing for relative pres-\\n tige and status.\\n\\n Most interaction probably does not cor-\\n respond exactly to any of these three situa-\\n tions but rather to intermediate orientations\\n involving their combination: for example,\\n Person may place some positive weight\\n on the welfare of Other, but not so much\\n as on his own. The cases in which Person\\n maximizes P + 0, P alone, and P - 0\\n serve as defining orientations to establish\\n a continuum of degrees of altruism, on\\n which pure co-operation and pure compe-\\n tition are extremes, and pure individualism\\n the midpoint. Then Person may be re-\\n garded, not simply as evidencing one of\\n three tendencies, but more generally as\\n maximizing P + aO, where a (altruism)\\n normally ranges from 1.0 (pure co-\\n operation) through 0 (individualism) to\\n -1.0 (pure competition). The relative\\n weight placed upon the welfare of the\\n other is thus summarized in a single param-\\n eter, a-the assessment of which is the\\n purpose of the Altruism Scale.\\n\\n In the present formulation, altruism is\\n not necessarily opposed to egoism; it is\\n possible (as in pure co-operation, when\\n a equals 1.0) to be equally concerned with\\n both one\\'s own and the other\\'s welfare.\\n Altruism is not incompatible with a desire\\n for greater individual welfare.

Though\\n this extreme act is relatively rare, lesser\\n degrees of selflessness are common and\\n find favor with various moral systems.\\n Logic, however, cannot universally recom-\\n mend even such lesser degrees of selfless-\\n ness. In fact, it is reasonable for the\\n altruism of one of two interacting persons\\n to exceed 1.0 only if the other\\'s does not:\\n Only if, for example, a husband\\'s altruism\\n toward his wife is less than 1.0 can hers\\n toward him reasonably be greater than\\n 1.0; then they are agreeing that his wel-\\n fare is more important than hers.\\n\\n If, however, each person values the\\n other\\'s welfare more than his own, this\\n may cause an infinite regress in which\\n each person says, \"I want to do what you\\'d\\n like,\" and the intrinsic values, over-\\n shadowed by the altruistic values, may\\n never become known. For example, sup-\\n pose that, in dining together, each of us\\n would rather let the other have his choice\\n of restaurant. Then I will try to make\\n you believe that my preference is the\\n restaurant I think you like, and you will\\n do the same. Thus I will discount what\\n you say, and guess at your true preference.\\n If I guess wrong, you may eventually be-\\n come convinced that the restaurant I\\n claim I like is truly my preference (since\\n you know it\\'s not yours), and we may\\n thus go to a place neither of us prefers,\\n though each may think (for a time, at\\n least) that the other does.\\n\\n Toward the other end of the altruism\\n continuum, values of a less than -1.0\\n may also have unreasonable aspects. Com-\\n petition normally doesn\\'t go this far: If\\n\\n you and I are each trying to reach a goal\\n before the other, I may welcome an event\\n that slows me a week but slows you two\\n weeks-but this only implies a value of a\\n between 0 and -1.0. For a to be less\\n than -1.0, I have to be so interested\\n in your delay that I am willing to sustain\\n even greater delay myself; such a feeling,\\n especially if reciprocated, has highly\\n destructive implications.\\n\\n Thus both unusually high and low\\n values imply potential difficulties, and\\n values from -1.0 to 1.0-between pure\\n competition and pure co-operation-may\\n be considered to constitute a normal range.\\n Within this range, values should vary\\n widely, depending upon the situation and\\n upon the two persons. What levels of al-\\n truism are typical for given situations, per-\\n sons, and others is an empirical question,\\n but it seems likely that effective inter-\\n personal relations imply some moderately\\n positive value, definitely greater than 0\\n and less than 1.0.\\n\\n THE MEASUREMENT OF ALTRUISM\\n\\n The few previous attempts6 to measure\\n altruism objectively in individuals have\\n all approached it as a stable, general\\n characteristic.7 The present approach, how-\\n\\n \\' Raymond B.

For example, on(\\n may be altruistic toward peers but nol\\n toward subordinates, altruistic with pres.\\n tige but not with money, or vice versa.\\n\\n A direct and theoretically desirable way\\n to assess such variation in a person\\'s\\n altruistic behavior would be to observe him\\n in specific natural situations where he\\n makes choices that affect his own and\\n another\\'s welfare. But practical difficulties\\n of observation and methodological prob-\\n lems of uncontrolled and unknown biases\\n detract from this approach and suggest\\n what is perhaps the next best procedure:\\n Ask a person to report what he feels his\\n behavior would be in such situations. This\\n is the approach of the Altruism Scale,\\n which employs for this purpose two sepa-\\n rate measures-one a ranking of outcomes\\n for self and other, the other a direct esti-\\n mation of altruism on a scale from 1.0 to\\n -1.0.\\n\\n Ranking of outcomes.-Subjects (all of\\n whom were college students) received the\\n following written instructions:\\n\\n Imagine yourself in the following situation.\\n It is the beginning of the term and you are\\n taking, among other courses, an important\\n seminar in your area of specialization.

Rank\\n your preference for these nine outcomes in the\\n following situation. Place the numbers 1 (first\\n choice) to 9 in the cells of the accompanying\\n table, indicating your preference for each of\\n the combinations of grades for you and the\\n other student. If you have absolutely no prefer-\\n ence between two combinations, indicate this\\n by placing the same number in both of the cells.\\n I. The other person is one of your best\\n friends. You and he have been together in sev-\\n eral classes and seminars during the course of\\n your work here. You have enjoyed working\\n with him on joint projects.\\n\\n In Figure 1, the response matrix is\\n filled in as it would be by a purely co-\\n operative respondent, who cares exactly\\n as much about the other\\'s grade as about\\n his own. Two A\\'s are best and two C\\'s\\n worst, and it is better that one of them\\n have an A and the other a B than that\\n both have B\\'s, though the strictly co-\\n operative person does not care whether he\\n or the other person gets the A.\\n\\n A purely individualistic orientation re-\\n sults in choices as in Figure 2, where a\\n person prefers first the three combinations\\n that give him an A, but does not dis-\\n criminate among these by the grade the\\n other receives. The third defining orienta-\\n tion-pure competition-is represented in\\n Figure 3. Most preferred is an A for one-\\n self and a C for the other, and the oppo-\\n site is the least preferred. A purely\\n competitive person is indifferent between\\n an A for himself and a B for the other,\\n and a B for himself and a C for the other;\\n in both cases his relative advantage-his\\n only concern-is the same.8\\n\\n 8 It has been assumed, in computing a value for\\n altruism from these choices, that the utility of a B\\n lies halfway between that of an A and that of a C.\\n This was checked on the twenty-eight social science\\n students, whose direct estimates on a ten-point\\n scale placed a B, on the average, 55 per cent of\\n the distance from a C to an A.

Alternatively, how-\\n ever, the person can, as in the following\\n measure, estimate his value of a directly\\n upon a graphic scale.\\n\\n Direct scale estimation.-The scale\\n ranges from -1.0 to 1.0 by tenths, and the\\n person checks one of the resulting twenty-\\n one boxes. The scale is anchored by de-\\n scriptions attached to the boxes at the\\n ends and midpoint of the scale (the three\\n defining orientations) and to the boxes\\n halfway between these, as follows:\\n\\n 1.0 I am equially interested in how good his\\n\\n grade is and in how good my grade is\\n\\n .5 I am half as interested in how good his\\n grade is as I am in how good my grade is\\n .0 I am only interested in how good my\\n grade is; how good or poor his grade is\\n makes no difference to me\\n\\n 10 If a person\\'s preference for A\\'s does not exceed\\n his preference for C\\'s, the denominator is either zero\\n (making altruism indeterminate) or negative\\n (making it appear more altruistic to want lower\\n grades for the other, too). Such preferences show\\n the falsity, for a given person, of the initial\\n assumption that higher grades are preferred to\\n lower; for such a person, it is inappropriate to\\n assess altruism through grades, since these are not\\n something he values.\\n\\n :\" In practice, many subjects\\' rankings produce\\n values intermediate between those of pure co-\\n operation, individualism, and competition. One\\n prominent modification of these defining orien-\\n tations is simply resolving tied ranks in one\\'s own\\n favor. For example, instead of the pure individ-\\n ualism of Figure 2, a person might prefer higher\\n grades for the other whenever it involved no sacri-\\n fice in his own grade. This orientation would\\n produce ranks of 1, 2, and 3 in the first row;\\n 4, 5, and 6 in the second row; and 7, 8, and 9\\n in the third row, resulting in an altruism of .33\\n instead of .00.\\n\\n -.5 I am equally interested in how much bet-\\n\\n ter my grade is than his and in how good\\n my grade is per se\\n\\n -1.0 I am only interested in how much better\\n my grade is than his; I do not care how\\n good my grade is per se\\n\\n The italicized words emphasize to the\\n respondent the relation between his and\\n the other\\'s welfare at each of the five\\n anchor points.\\'2 The words are chosen to\\n correspond to values of a in the general\\n expression P + aO of the total weighted\\n welfare. For the first three alternatives,\\n the value of a is directly specified (by\\n the words equally, half, and only). The\\n fourth anchor statement specifies equal in-\\n terest in P - 0 and in P, a total of\\n 2P - 0, which is relatively the same as\\n P - .50. In the last anchor statement, the\\n word \"better\" specifies P - 0 as the\\n criterion.\\n\\n Thus defined by these five statements,\\n this scale reflects the same rationale that\\n underlies the previously described measure-\\n ment through rankings; rather than in-\\n ferring altruism from choices that allocate\\n welfare, however, direct estimation as-\\n sumes that a person can make a reasonable\\n estimate of his preference for his own and\\n other\\'s welfare. This serves to quantify\\n such common feelings as \"I\\'d do as much\\n for him as for myself,\" \"I\\'m just looking\\n out for myself,\" and \"All I care about is\\n beating him.\" A design to examine how\\n well it serves is specified in the next sec-\\n tion.\\n\\n VALIDATION PROCEDURE\\n\\n The purpose was to determine the extent\\n to which the Altruism Scale possesses both\\n generality (over different measures and\\n situations) and discriminability (among\\n groups and alters for whom altruism should\\n differ).

More than\\n the other groups, the social science stu-\\n dents act in accord with principles of ex-\\n change and reciprocity.19 Grossly, the\\n tendencies differentiating the three groups\\n may be put as follows: YMCA students\\n help everyone, business students help\\n themselves, and social science students\\n help those who help them.\\n\\n Individual characteristics.-These group\\n differences on altruism are reinforced in\\n two ways by relations for the characteristic\\n of authoritarianism, as measured by the\\n F Scale.20 First, altruism appears to be\\n quite distinct from authoritarianism, as\\n evidenced by the correlation of -.03, over\\n all 122 individuals, between a person\\'s F\\n Scale and his total score on altruism,\\n summed over the twelve measures. Even\\n separate scores, computed for altruism\\n toward friends, toward strangers, and\\n toward antagonists, and for grades and\\n for salary, all correlate less than .10 with\\n the F Scale.\\n\\n Second, the F Scale itself discriminates\\n among the three groups in a way that\\n appears reasonable, lending further cre-\\n dence to their use as standards: Business\\n students are the most authoritarian, social\\n science students the least, and YMCA col-\\n lege students-whose lower-middle-class\\n background suggests authoritarianism, but\\n whose social service orientation suggests\\n the reverse-are in the middle.\\n\\n Two sex differences appeared. Among\\n YMCA college students, women are gen-\\n erally even more altruistic-toward friend,\\n stranger, or antagonist-than are men. Con-\\n sidering the background of these students,\\n it seems reasonable for them to display\\n what is probably the general norm, belief,\\n and fact-that women are more altruistic.\\n\\n \\' Blau, op. cit.; Gouldner, op. cit.; Homans, op.\\n\\n cit.\\n\\n \\'2 Theodore W. Adorno et al., The Authoritarian\\n\\n Personality (New York: Harper, 1950).\\n\\n In social science, a less conventional field\\n for women, their responses are more simi-\\n lar to those of men. Only in their failure\\n to share men\\'s unusual punitiveness\\n toward antagonists do they differ marked-\\n ly; women\\'s altruism toward antagonists\\n is -.22, men\\'s -.42. If, within social sci-\\n ence, these women are less likely than\\n are men to achieve full-time professional\\n status, it seems reasonable that they are\\n also less likely to see antagonists as com-\\n petitors whom one wishes ill.21\\n\\n Within the males of the YMCA college\\n group, two variables of family struc-\\n ture relate to altruism.22 The 30 per cent\\n who are married have a mean altruism of\\n .39; mean altruism for single males is .15.\\n The number of older sisters correlates .35\\n with total altruism; for men having no\\n older sisters, mean altruism is .14, for those\\n having at least one older sister, mean\\n altruism is .47. Number of older brothers,\\n younger brothers, or younger sisters is not\\n related to altruism.\\n\\n To understand why only the older-\\n sister sibling relation might be associated\\n with altruism, one should recognize that\\n of the four possible age-sex combinations\\n for a pair of siblings (twins excepted), only\\n the pairing of an older sister and a younger\\n brother fails to produce a clear dominance.\\n Among like-sex pairs, the older is domi-\\n\\n 21 Comparing males alone among the three groups\\n leaves the findings essentially unchanged. The\\n slightly greater differentiation among friend,\\n stranger, and antagonist made by male social sci-\\n ence students (16 of the 28) distinguishes some-\\n what further that group from the others. There\\n is little or no change in the other groups, since, of\\n the YMCA students, less than 15 per cent were\\n women, and of the business students, none.\\n\\n \\' For the YMCA group, but not the other two,\\n additional variables were available: 14 background\\n characteristics, 7 paired self-descriptive adjectives\\n (co-operative-competitive, etc.), and 13 activity\\n preferences (singing, solitaire, etc.). Many of these\\n variables were significantly related to one or sev-\\n eral of the-altruism scales, but none related as con-\\n sistently to all twelve altruism scales as did marital\\n status and number of older sisters of the male\\n students. Female YMCA students were too few\\n for reliable analysis.\\n\\nThis content downloaded from 170.140.26.180 on Mon, 06 Jun 2016 19:10:40 UTC\\n\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\n\\n\\x0c 416 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY\\n\\n nant, while an older brother is clearly\\n dominant over a younger sister. But in\\n the older sister-younger brother combina-\\n tion, dominance of the older and domi-\\n nance of the male may be partially com-\\n pensatory-and by thus having a more\\n nearly equal sibling relation, the boy with\\n an older sister may thereby have a greater\\n chance to learn the value of co-operation.\\n This interpretation is also consistent with\\n the greater altruism of married men; it\\n may in both relations be the opportunity\\n for prolonged and intensive co-operation\\n with a near equal-whether an older sis-\\n ter or a wife-that causes these experiences\\n to relate to the display of altruism.\\n\\n Internal consistency.-The most direct\\n index of over-all altruism, across the vari-\\n ous alters, measures, and situations, is\\n simply the sum of the twelve separate\\n scores a subject receives; considered as\\n a twelve-item scale, this measure of\\n altruism has an internal-consistency re-\\n liability of .79.23 Other consistencies ap-\\n pear between particular subsets of scores:\\n A composite score for the four scales in-\\n volving a stranger correlates .63 with a\\n corresponding composite for friends and\\n .57 with one for antagonists. Thus not\\n only is altruism toward strangers midway\\n between that toward friends and antagonists\\n (as previously shown by the means) but it\\n is equally related to each. The correlation\\n between the two more distant points of\\n friend and antagonist is correspondingly\\n less: .31.\\n\\n Altruism in situations involving grades\\n corresponds rather closely to altruism in\\n situations involving salary; the correla-\\n tion between the two six-item composites\\n is .75. Correlation between the six-item\\n composite measuring altruism by direct\\n subjective estimation and the composite\\n\\n measuring it by ranking is much smaller:\\n .32. Despite the logical relation that con-\\n nects the two modes of measurement,\\n subjects are far from perfectly consistent\\n in their responses. This discrepancy may\\n result partly from lack of understanding\\n or of motivation by the subjects, since the\\n task is in some ways novel and complex.\\n However, complete ranking of pairs of\\n grades-the more difficult task-can be\\n achieved instead by presenting a number\\n of paired comparisons, each calling only\\n for a preference for one pair of grades or\\n another.\\n\\n The low correlation of the two measures\\n may also partially reflect multidimension-\\n ality in the rankings. Direct estimation on\\n the twenty-one-point scales promotes uni-\\n dimensional judgments, but ranking the\\n nine pairs of outcomes in the matrix makes\\n it easy for persons to consider more than\\n the single dimension of altruism. One\\n added principle is egalitarianism-indeed\\n shown by some subjects, who prefer first\\n A\\'s for both, then B\\'s for both, then C\\'s\\n for both; by preferring these over such\\n alternatives as A for one and B for the\\n other, they show that they value strict\\n equality more than absolute level of re-\\n ward.24 Such egalitarianism warrants sepa-\\n rate assessment as another principle for\\n allocating rewards between persons-\\n though one that in these data accounts\\n for fewer choices than does altruism.\\n\\n Everything considered, the present re-\\n search shows the Altruism Scale to assess,\\n with moderate validity and reliability, a\\n continuum, ranging from co-operation\\n through individualism to competition, that\\n defines a central orientation of a person\\n toward the rewards he and another expe-\\n rience in interaction.\\n\\n UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO\\n\\n -3The value is for Cronbach\\'s alpha, which in\\n effect gives the reliability that would be obtained\\n by correlating total scores over one set of six items\\n with total scores over the remaining set of six items,\\n averaged over all possible splits of items into two\\n groups of six.

Let the welfare of Person be P and\\n that of Other be 0. Then if Person is purely co-operative, he maximizes P + 0; if purely competi-\\n tive, he maximizes P - 0; and if purely individualistic, he maximizes P alone. More generally, he maxi-\\n mizes P + aO, where a (altruism) normally ranges from 1.0 to -1.0. To assess a, Person either directly\\n estimates its value on a scale from 1.0 to -1.0 or ranks his preferences for various outcomes for him-\\n self and for Other. Both measures show that (1) three college groups all differentiate among friend,\\n stranger, and antagonist, (2) YMCA college students are generally more positively oriented toward the\\n other\\'s welfare-friend, stranger, or antagonist, (3) business students maximize their own reward more,\\n and (4) social science students differentiate most between friends and antagonists.\\n\\n The Altruism Scale assesses the value\\n one places upon the welfare of another in\\n relation to his own. This measure is in-\\n tended to correspond generally to con-\\n ceptualizations of altruism both from\\n psychology (\"affection and concern for\\n others\") and from sociology (\"where the\\n goal of conduct [of the ego] is exterior to\\n itself\"), as well as to more general defini-\\n tion (\"the principle or practice of seeking\\n the welfare of others\").2\\n\\n 1 The author is grateful to Norman Bradburn of\\n the University of Chicago Graduate School of Busi-\\n ness and to Clifford Holmes and Alex Shukin of\\n George Williams College for aid in obtaining\\n subjects; to Lawrence Carson, Brian Heller, and\\n Thomas Tyler for assistance in the analysis of the\\n data; to Peter Blau for comments on the manu-\\n script; and, particularly, to Morris Friedell for\\n insightful contributions to the conceptualization\\n as well as to later stages of this research.

Such a formulation, deriving from\\n and elaborating upon bargaining and game\\n theory, has proven highly provocative of\\n both conceptual and empirical analysis.5\\n\\n As conceived in this analysis, a person\\'s\\n selection among alternative actions de-\\n pends, to some degree, upon the resultant\\n welfare not only to himself but to the other\\n as well. Explicitly or implicitly, he places\\n a certain weight upon the other\\'s welfare\\n in relation to his own. Three particular\\n values of this weight are of special in-\\n terest, for they define the following promi-\\n nent orientations.\\n\\n Co-operation, individualism, and comn-\\n\\n petition.-Assume that Person is inter-\\n acting with Other in a situation in which\\n there are several possible outcomes, not all\\n equally favorable to both. Then, in arriv-\\n ing at a preference among these outcomes,\\n three prominent orientations that Person\\n can take are these: (1) He can prefer that\\n outcome in which the sum of his welfare\\n and that of Other is the greatest; (2) he\\n can simply prefer that outcome in which\\n his own welfare is the greatest, irrespec-\\n tive of Other\\'s; or (3) he can prefer that\\n outcome in which the relative advantage of\\n his welfare over Other\\'s is the greatest.\\n\\n 5See R. Duncan Luce and Howard Raiffa, Games\\n and Decisions (New York: John Wiley & Sons,\\n 1957), for a general exposition of game theory, em-\\n phasizing its relation to the social sciences; Thomas\\n C. Schelling, The Strategy of Conflict (Cambridge,\\n Mass.: Harvard University, 1960), for insightful\\n intuitive extensions involving threats and prom-\\n ises, commitment, credibility, etc.; Anatol Rapo-\\n port and Carol Orwant, \"Experimental Games:\\n A Review,\" Behavioral Science, VII (January,\\n 1962), 1-3 7, for empirical research; and Jack\\n Sawyer and Morris F. Friedell, \"The Interaction\\n Screen: An Operational Model for Experimentation\\n on Interpersonal Behavior,\" Behavioral Science,\\n X (October, 1965), 446-60, for an articulation with\\n various constructs of interpersonal behavior.\\n\\n These three orientations may be con-\\n sidered as pure co-operation, pure indi-\\n vidualism, and pure competition, and the\\n conceptual element that differentiates them\\n is the weight Person places upon the wel-\\n fare (0) of Other in relation to his own\\n (P). If Person is acting purely co-opera-\\n tively, he maximizes P + 0; if acting\\n purely individualistically, he maximizes P\\n alone; and if acting purely competitively,\\n he maximizes P - 0. Examples of pure\\n co-operation, individualism, and competi-\\n tion occur in the interaction of (1) hus-\\n band and wife striving to augment family\\n income, (2) entrepreneurs each attempting\\n merely to maximize his own profit, and (3)\\n bureaucrats competing for relative pres-\\n tige and status.\\n\\n Most interaction probably does not cor-\\n respond exactly to any of these three situa-\\n tions but rather to intermediate orientations\\n involving their combination: for example,\\n Person may place some positive weight\\n on the welfare of Other, but not so much\\n as on his own. The cases in which Person\\n maximizes P + 0, P alone, and P - 0\\n serve as defining orientations to establish\\n a continuum of degrees of altruism, on\\n which pure co-operation and pure compe-\\n tition are extremes, and pure individualism\\n the midpoint. Then Person may be re-\\n garded, not simply as evidencing one of\\n three tendencies, but more generally as\\n maximizing P + aO, where a (altruism)\\n normally ranges from 1.0 (pure co-\\n operation) through 0 (individualism) to\\n -1.0 (pure competition). The relative\\n weight placed upon the welfare of the\\n other is thus summarized in a single param-\\n eter, a-the assessment of which is the\\n purpose of the Altruism Scale.\\n\\n In the present formulation, altruism is\\n not necessarily opposed to egoism; it is\\n possible (as in pure co-operation, when\\n a equals 1.0) to be equally concerned with\\n both one\\'s own and the other\\'s welfare.\\n Altruism is not incompatible with a desire\\n for greater individual welfare.

Though\\n this extreme act is relatively rare, lesser\\n degrees of selflessness are common and\\n find favor with various moral systems.\\n Logic, however, cannot universally recom-\\n mend even such lesser degrees of selfless-\\n ness. In fact, it is reasonable for the\\n altruism of one of two interacting persons\\n to exceed 1.0 only if the other\\'s does not:\\n Only if, for example, a husband\\'s altruism\\n toward his wife is less than 1.0 can hers\\n toward him reasonably be greater than\\n 1.0; then they are agreeing that his wel-\\n fare is more important than hers.\\n\\n If, however, each person values the\\n other\\'s welfare more than his own, this\\n may cause an infinite regress in which\\n each person says, \"I want to do what you\\'d\\n like,\" and the intrinsic values, over-\\n shadowed by the altruistic values, may\\n never become known. For example, sup-\\n pose that, in dining together, each of us\\n would rather let the other have his choice\\n of restaurant. Then I will try to make\\n you believe that my preference is the\\n restaurant I think you like, and you will\\n do the same. Thus I will discount what\\n you say, and guess at your true preference.\\n If I guess wrong, you may eventually be-\\n come convinced that the restaurant I\\n claim I like is truly my preference (since\\n you know it\\'s not yours), and we may\\n thus go to a place neither of us prefers,\\n though each may think (for a time, at\\n least) that the other does.\\n\\n Toward the other end of the altruism\\n continuum, values of a less than -1.0\\n may also have unreasonable aspects. Com-\\n petition normally doesn\\'t go this far: If\\n\\n you and I are each trying to reach a goal\\n before the other, I may welcome an event\\n that slows me a week but slows you two\\n weeks-but this only implies a value of a\\n between 0 and -1.0. For a to be less\\n than -1.0, I have to be so interested\\n in your delay that I am willing to sustain\\n even greater delay myself; such a feeling,\\n especially if reciprocated, has highly\\n destructive implications.\\n\\n Thus both unusually high and low\\n values imply potential difficulties, and\\n values from -1.0 to 1.0-between pure\\n competition and pure co-operation-may\\n be considered to constitute a normal range.\\n Within this range, values should vary\\n widely, depending upon the situation and\\n upon the two persons. What levels of al-\\n truism are typical for given situations, per-\\n sons, and others is an empirical question,\\n but it seems likely that effective inter-\\n personal relations imply some moderately\\n positive value, definitely greater than 0\\n and less than 1.0.\\n\\n THE MEASUREMENT OF ALTRUISM\\n\\n The few previous attempts6 to measure\\n altruism objectively in individuals have\\n all approached it as a stable, general\\n characteristic.7 The present approach, how-\\n\\n \\' Raymond B.

It so\\n happens that there is only one other student\\n in the seminar. You are both taking the course\\n for credit, however, and each of you will re-\\n ceive one of the grades, A, B, or C. Since there\\n\\n tractiveness as a friend,\" suggesting that they\\n might simply tap a slightly different aspect of\\n friendliness. The average absolute correlation of\\n self and others\\' rating with twenty other variables\\n thought possibly indicative of altruism was .07;\\n only one of these forty correlations reached .15.\\n Perhaps because of such difficulties, the few\\n measures of altruism so far constructed appear to\\n have experienced little research use: A search of\\n Sociological Abstracts, since its inception in 1953,\\n and of Psychological Abstracts for the same period,\\n under \"altruism\" and the names of the authors of\\n the four articles, reveals no use of these or similar\\n measures.\\n\\n are three possible outcomes for each of you,\\n and the instructor assigns grades independently,\\n there exist nine possible combinations of out-\\n comes, ranging from both A\\'s to both C\\'s. Rank\\n your preference for these nine outcomes in the\\n following situation. Place the numbers 1 (first\\n choice) to 9 in the cells of the accompanying\\n table, indicating your preference for each of\\n the combinations of grades for you and the\\n other student. If you have absolutely no prefer-\\n ence between two combinations, indicate this\\n by placing the same number in both of the cells.\\n I. The other person is one of your best\\n friends. You and he have been together in sev-\\n eral classes and seminars during the course of\\n your work here. You have enjoyed working\\n with him on joint projects.\\n\\n In Figure 1, the response matrix is\\n filled in as it would be by a purely co-\\n operative respondent, who cares exactly\\n as much about the other\\'s grade as about\\n his own. Two A\\'s are best and two C\\'s\\n worst, and it is better that one of them\\n have an A and the other a B than that\\n both have B\\'s, though the strictly co-\\n operative person does not care whether he\\n or the other person gets the A.\\n\\n A purely individualistic orientation re-\\n sults in choices as in Figure 2, where a\\n person prefers first the three combinations\\n that give him an A, but does not dis-\\n criminate among these by the grade the\\n other receives. The third defining orienta-\\n tion-pure competition-is represented in\\n Figure 3. Most preferred is an A for one-\\n self and a C for the other, and the oppo-\\n site is the least preferred. A purely\\n competitive person is indifferent between\\n an A for himself and a B for the other,\\n and a B for himself and a C for the other;\\n in both cases his relative advantage-his\\n only concern-is the same.8\\n\\n 8 It has been assumed, in computing a value for\\n altruism from these choices, that the utility of a B\\n lies halfway between that of an A and that of a C.\\n This was checked on the twenty-eight social science\\n students, whose direct estimates on a ten-point\\n scale placed a B, on the average, 55 per cent of\\n the distance from a C to an A. Only three students\\n placed a B less than 40 per cent or more than\\n 70 per cent of the way from a C to an A.

Alternatively, how-\\n ever, the person can, as in the following\\n measure, estimate his value of a directly\\n upon a graphic scale.\\n\\n Direct scale estimation.-The scale\\n ranges from -1.0 to 1.0 by tenths, and the\\n person checks one of the resulting twenty-\\n one boxes. The scale is anchored by de-\\n scriptions attached to the boxes at the\\n ends and midpoint of the scale (the three\\n defining orientations) and to the boxes\\n halfway between these, as follows:\\n\\n 1.0 I am equially interested in how good his\\n\\n grade is and in how good my grade is\\n\\n .5 I am half as interested in how good his\\n grade is as I am in how good my grade is\\n .0 I am only interested in how good my\\n grade is; how good or poor his grade is\\n makes no difference to me\\n\\n 10 If a person\\'s preference for A\\'s does not exceed\\n his preference for C\\'s, the denominator is either zero\\n (making altruism indeterminate) or negative\\n (making it appear more altruistic to want lower\\n grades for the other, too). Such preferences show\\n the falsity, for a given person, of the initial\\n assumption that higher grades are preferred to\\n lower; for such a person, it is inappropriate to\\n assess altruism through grades, since these are not\\n something he values.\\n\\n :\" In practice, many subjects\\' rankings produce\\n values intermediate between those of pure co-\\n operation, individualism, and competition. One\\n prominent modification of these defining orien-\\n tations is simply resolving tied ranks in one\\'s own\\n favor. For example, instead of the pure individ-\\n ualism of Figure 2, a person might prefer higher\\n grades for the other whenever it involved no sacri-\\n fice in his own grade. This orientation would\\n produce ranks of 1, 2, and 3 in the first row;\\n 4, 5, and 6 in the second row; and 7, 8, and 9\\n in the third row, resulting in an altruism of .33\\n instead of .00.\\n\\n -.5 I am equally interested in how much bet-\\n\\n ter my grade is than his and in how good\\n my grade is per se\\n\\n -1.0 I am only interested in how much better\\n my grade is than his; I do not care how\\n good my grade is per se\\n\\n The italicized words emphasize to the\\n respondent the relation between his and\\n the other\\'s welfare at each of the five\\n anchor points.\\'2 The words are chosen to\\n correspond to values of a in the general\\n expression P + aO of the total weighted\\n welfare. For the first three alternatives,\\n the value of a is directly specified (by\\n the words equally, half, and only). The\\n fourth anchor statement specifies equal in-\\n terest in P - 0 and in P, a total of\\n 2P - 0, which is relatively the same as\\n P - .50. In the last anchor statement, the\\n word \"better\" specifies P - 0 as the\\n criterion.\\n\\n Thus defined by these five statements,\\n this scale reflects the same rationale that\\n underlies the previously described measure-\\n ment through rankings; rather than in-\\n ferring altruism from choices that allocate\\n welfare, however, direct estimation as-\\n sumes that a person can make a reasonable\\n estimate of his preference for his own and\\n other\\'s welfare. This serves to quantify\\n such common feelings as \"I\\'d do as much\\n for him as for myself,\" \"I\\'m just looking\\n out for myself,\" and \"All I care about is\\n beating him.\" A design to examine how\\n well it serves is specified in the next sec-\\n tion.\\n\\n VALIDATION PROCEDURE\\n\\n The purpose was to determine the extent\\n to which the Altruism Scale possesses both\\n generality (over different measures and\\n situations) and discriminability (among\\n groups and alters for whom altruism should\\n differ).

Altruism toward a friend is\\n substantially greater than that toward a\\n stranger, which in turn is substantially\\n greater than that toward an antagonist.18\\n The over-all averages, .45, .12, and -.18,\\n place the stranger almost exactly halfway\\n between the friend and the antagonist;\\n there is slight positive altruism toward\\n strangers; and though altruism toward\\n antagonists is negative, it is considerably\\n smaller in absolute magnitude than the\\n positive altruism shown toward friends.\\n\\n Group differences.-YMCA college stu-\\n dents are generally more altruistic; their\\n mean altruism toward all alters is .21, and\\n even toward an antagonist, it is barely nega-\\n tive. Social science and business students\\n both have mean altruism near zero, but dif-\\n fer in the extent to which they discriminate\\n among friend, stranger, and antagonist.\\n Responses of business students are almost\\n exactly balanced around the zero point,\\n with a spread of about .6 between friend\\n and antagonist.

More than\\n the other groups, the social science stu-\\n dents act in accord with principles of ex-\\n change and reciprocity.19 Grossly, the\\n tendencies differentiating the three groups\\n may be put as follows: YMCA students\\n help everyone, business students help\\n themselves, and social science students\\n help those who help them.\\n\\n Individual characteristics.-These group\\n differences on altruism are reinforced in\\n two ways by relations for the characteristic\\n of authoritarianism, as measured by the\\n F Scale.20 First, altruism appears to be\\n quite distinct from authoritarianism, as\\n evidenced by the correlation of -.03, over\\n all 122 individuals, between a person\\'s F\\n Scale and his total score on altruism,\\n summed over the twelve measures. Even\\n separate scores, computed for altruism\\n toward friends, toward strangers, and\\n toward antagonists, and for grades and\\n for salary, all correlate less than .10 with\\n the F Scale.\\n\\n Second, the F Scale itself discriminates\\n among the three groups in a way that\\n appears reasonable, lending further cre-\\n dence to their use as standards: Business\\n students are the most authoritarian, social\\n science students the least, and YMCA col-\\n lege students-whose lower-middle-class\\n background suggests authoritarianism, but\\n whose social service orientation suggests\\n the reverse-are in the middle.\\n\\n Two sex differences appeared. Among\\n YMCA college students, women are gen-\\n erally even more altruistic-toward friend,\\n stranger, or antagonist-than are men. Con-\\n sidering the background of these students,\\n it seems reasonable for them to display\\n what is probably the general norm, belief,\\n and fact-that women are more altruistic.\\n\\n \\' Blau, op. cit.; Gouldner, op. cit.; Homans, op.\\n\\n cit.\\n\\n \\'2 Theodore W. Adorno et al., The Authoritarian\\n\\n Personality (New York: Harper, 1950).\\n\\n In social science, a less conventional field\\n for women, their responses are more simi-\\n lar to those of men. Only in their failure\\n to share men\\'s unusual punitiveness\\n toward antagonists do they differ marked-\\n ly; women\\'s altruism toward antagonists\\n is -.22, men\\'s -.42. If, within social sci-\\n ence, these women are less likely than\\n are men to achieve full-time professional\\n status, it seems reasonable that they are\\n also less likely to see antagonists as com-\\n petitors whom one wishes ill.21\\n\\n Within the males of the YMCA college\\n group, two variables of family struc-\\n ture relate to altruism.22 The 30 per cent\\n who are married have a mean altruism of\\n .39; mean altruism for single males is .15.\\n The number of older sisters correlates .35\\n with total altruism; for men having no\\n older sisters, mean altruism is .14, for those\\n having at least one older sister, mean\\n altruism is .47. Number of older brothers,\\n younger brothers, or younger sisters is not\\n related to altruism.\\n\\n To understand why only the older-\\n sister sibling relation might be associated\\n with altruism, one should recognize that\\n of the four possible age-sex combinations\\n for a pair of siblings (twins excepted), only\\n the pairing of an older sister and a younger\\n brother fails to produce a clear dominance.\\n Among like-sex pairs, the older is domi-\\n\\n 21 Comparing males alone among the three groups\\n leaves the findings essentially unchanged. The\\n slightly greater differentiation among friend,\\n stranger, and antagonist made by male social sci-\\n ence students (16 of the 28) distinguishes some-\\n what further that group from the others. There\\n is little or no change in the other groups, since, of\\n the YMCA students, less than 15 per cent were\\n women, and of the business students, none.\\n\\n \\' For the YMCA group, but not the other two,\\n additional variables were available: 14 background\\n characteristics, 7 paired self-descriptive adjectives\\n (co-operative-competitive, etc.), and 13 activity\\n preferences (singing, solitaire, etc.). Many of these\\n variables were significantly related to one or sev-\\n eral of the-altruism scales, but none related as con-\\n sistently to all twelve altruism scales as did marital\\n status and number of older sisters of the male\\n students. Female YMCA students were too few\\n for reliable analysis.\\n\\nThis content downloaded from 170.140.26.180 on Mon, 06 Jun 2016 19:10:40 UTC\\n\\nAll use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms\\n\\n\\x0c 416 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY\\n\\n nant, while an older brother is clearly\\n dominant over a younger sister. But in\\n the older sister-younger brother combina-\\n tion, dominance of the older and domi-\\n nance of the male may be partially com-\\n pensatory-and by thus having a more\\n nearly equal sibling relation, the boy with\\n an older sister may thereby have a greater\\n chance to learn the value of co-operation.\\n This interpretation is also consistent with\\n the greater altruism of married men; it\\n may in both relations be the opportunity\\n for prolonged and intensive co-operation\\n with a near equal-whether an older sis-\\n ter or a wife-that causes these experiences\\n to relate to the display of altruism.\\n\\n Internal consistency.-The most direct\\n index of over-all altruism, across the vari-\\n ous alters, measures, and situations, is\\n simply the sum of the twelve separate\\n scores a subject receives; considered as\\n a twelve-item scale, this measure of\\n altruism has an internal-consistency re-\\n liability of .79.23 Other consistencies ap-\\n pear between particular subsets of scores:\\n A composite score for the four scales in-\\n volving a stranger correlates .63 with a\\n corresponding composite for friends and\\n .57 with one for antagonists. Thus not\\n only is altruism toward strangers midway\\n between that toward friends and antagonists\\n (as previously shown by the means) but it\\n is equally related to each. The correlation\\n between the two more distant points of\\n friend and antagonist is correspondingly\\n less: .31.\\n\\n Altruism in situations involving grades\\n corresponds rather closely to altruism in\\n situations involving salary; the correla-\\n tion between the two six-item composites\\n is .75. Correlation between the six-item\\n composite measuring altruism by direct\\n subjective estimation and the composite\\n\\n measuring it by ranking is much smaller:\\n .32. Despite the logical relation that con-\\n nects the two modes of measurement,\\n subjects are far from perfectly consistent\\n in their responses. This discrepancy may\\n result partly from lack of understanding\\n or of motivation by the subjects, since the\\n task is in some ways novel and complex.\\n However, complete ranking of pairs of\\n grades-the more difficult task-can be\\n achieved instead by presenting a number\\n of paired comparisons, each calling only\\n for a preference for one pair of grades or\\n another.\\n\\n The low correlation of the two measures\\n may also partially reflect multidimension-\\n ality in the rankings. Direct estimation on\\n the twenty-one-point scales promotes uni-\\n dimensional judgments, but ranking the\\n nine pairs of outcomes in the matrix makes\\n it easy for persons to consider more than\\n the single dimension of altruism. One\\n added principle is egalitarianism-indeed\\n shown by some subjects, who prefer first\\n A\\'s for both, then B\\'s for both, then C\\'s\\n for both; by preferring these over such\\n alternatives as A for one and B for the\\n other, they show that they value strict\\n equality more than absolute level of re-\\n ward.24 Such egalitarianism warrants sepa-\\n rate assessment as another principle for\\n allocating rewards between persons-\\n though one that in these data accounts\\n for fewer choices than does altruism.\\n\\n Everything considered, the present re-\\n search shows the Altruism Scale to assess,\\n with moderate validity and reliability, a\\n continuum, ranging from co-operation\\n through individualism to competition, that\\n defines a central orientation of a person\\n toward the rewards he and another expe-\\n rience in interaction.\\n\\n UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO\\n\\n -3The value is for Cronbach\\'s alpha, which in\\n effect gives the reliability that would be obtained\\n by correlating total scores over one set of six items\\n with total scores over the remaining set of six items,\\n averaged over all possible splits of items into two\\n groups of six.
