esearch on the relationship between com-

munity size and a variety of personality di-
mensions has generally found relatively weak
effects (Fischer 1984). These findings provide
the empirical basis for the claim prevalent in ur-
ban sociology that urbanism has only modest so-
cial psychological consequences (Palen 1979;
Fischer 1984, p. 6;, Fischer 1975, p. 422; Fischer
1982, p. 256; theoretical arguments consistent
with the claim appear in Gans 1962a; Gans 1962b;
Lewis 1952; Lewis 1965; Reiss 1955; Hauser
1970). I re-examine urbanism’s effect on toler-
ance, taking particular care to assess the effect of
individuals’ urban experience — that is, expo-
sure to population concentration. I also re-exam-
ine the effect of migration on tolerance levels
and argue that past studies confuse migrants with
nonmigrants.

Tolerance is the willingness to allow the ex-
pression of divergent ideas and to treat others
according to universalistic criteria independent
of value differences (cf. Crick 1973; Parsons and
Shils 1951). Tolerance has generally been oper-
ationalized as a willingness to extend civil liber-
ties to persons holding deviant religious or po-
litical views.' Stouffer (1955) was the first to re-
port that urbanism, measured in terms of com-
munity size, is directly related to tolerance. Recent
research has generally confirmed Stouffer’s

' Other tolerance indicators weakly but significant-
ly related to urbanism include attitudes toward pre-
marital sex and other sexual behavior, abortion, mar-
ijuana legalization, and gay rights (Stephan and Mc-
Mullin 1982; Fischer 1982, chap. 6; see differing
findings in Fischer 1971).
findings (Wilson 1975; Glenn and Alston 1967;
Williams, Nunn, and St. Peter 1976; Smith and
Petersen 1980; Abrahamson and Carter 1986;
Wilson 1985; contrary findings are reported in
Marcus, Piereson and Sullivan 1980). The few
studies addressing size of present community and
size of community of origin show that size of
community of origin affects tolerance as well as
size of present community (Glenn and Hill 1977;
Smith and Petersen 1980; Wilson 1985). In gen-
eral, these studies show only a weak effect of
urbanism on tolerance. For example, size of
present community explained only .6 percent of
the variation in tolerance in Abrahamson and
Carter’s (1986) study, and its net relationship
with five tolerance scales was also weak in Wil-
son’s (1985) analysis (average beta = .09).

I argue that past research is inadequate to sup-
port claims of only a modest effect of urbanism
on social psychological factors. Urbanism is a
quality not only of communities (determined by
population size), but also of persons’ experience
(determined by persons’ exposure to life in pop-
ulous communities; Wirth 1956; Fischer 1984,
p. 5).? Urban experience is the theoretical means
by which population size affects personality,
promoting tolerance by enabling residents to “rub
shoulders” with diverse others, and exposing them
to the “juxtapositions of divergent personalities
and modes of life” from which they learn to “live
and let live” (Stouffer 1955; Wirth 1938; Milgram
1970). Furthermore, the effect of urban experience
is expected to be enduring: exposure to urban life
occurring throughout one’s past as well as that

? Criteria other than population size have been used
to define urbanism (see Castells 1976; Firey, Loomis,
and Beegle 1957; Reissman 1964; Greer 1962), but
population size is the most common. Its advantages
are discussed in Fischer (1984, pp. 24-5).
experienced in the present influences personality
in general and tolerance levels in particular (Wirth
1938; cf. Stouffer 1955; Smith and Petersen 1980;
Grasmick and Grasmick 1978; Stephan and Mc-
Mullin 1982; Fischer 1975; Fischer 1982; Fisch-
er 1984, p. 218).

Measures of urbanism in past research do not
adequately tap urban experience. Table | presents
a typology of urban experience based on three
variables: present community size; size of com-
munity of origin; and whether one still resides in
the community of origin. The community size
measures adequately tap urban experience only
for persons who are life-long residents of a pop-
ulation-stable community (type |). For no other
type or subtype do the community size measures
provide an unambiguous full reflection of urban
experience. For migrants (subtypes 2c, 2d, and
2e), present community size and size of com-
munity of origin provide no information on in-
tervening urban experience. For many migrants,
repeated moves between communities of varying
sizes are quite common (Zuiches 1981; Berry
and Dahmen 1977; Hawley and Mazie 1981;
Brown and Wardwell 1980; Ford 1978; Tucker
1976). Similarly, for nonmigrants (subtypes 2a
and 2b) origin community size and present
community size measures reflect neither the on-
set nor speed of community growth or decline,
and so provide no information on respondents’
urban experience when their community’s size
was between origin and present levels. In sum,
because past studies have found undramatic ef-
fects of size of community of origin and/or present
community size on personality dimensions, it does
not follow that the effect of urban experience is
similarly modest.

Past studies are also inconclusive concerning
the effect of migration between various-sized
communities. Wirth (1938) suggested that ex-
posure to the city’s social heterogeneity promotes
tolerance, implying that movement to larger
communities increases migrants’ tolerance levels,
but that migration to smaller communities does
not. Stouffer (1955) argued that the migrant ex-
perience of culture shock — exposure to two
disparate cultures, the rural and the urban — in-
creases tolerance among migrants regardless of
size of destination community. Empirical studies
support Wirth: migrants to larger communities
Become slightly more tolerant than individuals
remaining behind, but migrants to smaller com-
munities do not differ in tolerance from nonmi-
grants (Smith and Petersen 1980; Wilson 1985).
However, these studies determine migration status
by comparing sizes of respondents’ present and
origin communities: respondents whose origin
and present community sizes were identical were
assumed to be nonmigrants; those whose origin
community was smaller than their present com-
munity were assumed to be migrants to more
urban communities; and those whose origin
community was larger than their present com-
munity were assumed to be migrants to less urban
communities. As Table 1 shows, these assump-
tions lead to classification errors that cast doubt
on any resulting findings: migrants between same
sized communities (type 2c) would be classified
as nonmigrants; and nonmigrants in growing or
declining communities (types 2a and 2b) would
be classified as migrants.
SMSA with central city between 50,000 and
250,000; SMSA with central city of over 250,000.
Size of community of origin is based on a six-
category nominal scale tapping community size
at age 16 that was collapsed and recoded into the
same four dummy variables as size of present
community. Migrant status — whether respon-
dent has moved from community of origin — is
a dummy variable with migrant coded 1. The
distribution of cases across the urban experience
types is shown in Table 1.3

Tolerance measures are based on 15 dichoto-
mous items, patterned after those developed by
Stouffer (1955), that tap respondent’ s willingness
to extend civil liberties (the right to teach in a
college, to make a speech, or to have an authored
book in the public library) to each of five target
groups.‘ Using these 15 items, I constructed two
composite measures of tolerance — one toward
leftist groups (Communists, atheists, and homo-
sexuals) and the other toward rightist groups
(racists and militarists). Each measure, calculat-
ed as the average summed score for items per-
taining to each relevant group, is a continuous
scale ranging from 0 to 3 with higher scores indi-
cating greater tolerance.

It is important to control for respondents’ per-
sonal characteristics when assessing urbanism’s
effect (Gans 1962a; Wirth 1956; Fischer 1984).
Controls for education (years of school com-
pleted) and age are particularly crucial because

3 Size of present community reflects objective size
data coded by NORC staff, whereas size of origin
community is recalled by respondents, a less reliable
though commonly-used measure (see Fischer 1984,
p. 315). Also, some type | respondents in Table | may
have lived elsewhere between age 16 and the inter-
view date; NORC data do not allow us to identify
such respondents.

* These items, long used in tolerance research,
equate tolerance with the extent to which respondents
are opposed to the ideas or interests of particular groups
(Sullivan, Piereson, and Marcus 1979; Marcus,
Piereson, and Sullivan 1980). Respondents’ opposi-
tion is more likely with use of a broad variety of target
groups. Wording of the tolerance items for atheists is
as follows:

There are always some people whose ideas are
considered bad or dangerous by other people. For
example, somebody who is against all churches and
religions . . . (a) If such a person wanted to make a
speech in your community against churches and reli-
gions, should he be allowed to, or not? (b) Should
such a person be allowed to teach in a college or
university, or not? (c) If some people in your commu-
nity suggested that a book he wrote against churches
and religions should be taken out of your public li-
Table 2 reports results of regressions of tolerance
measures on size of present community (with
“open country” as the reference category), size
of origin community (“open country” is again
the reference category), migration status, and the
control variables, for the national sample. Both
community-size variables are significantly related
to greater tolerance toward both rightists and
leftists (except present community “<50,000” in
the rightist analysis) but the effects are modest.
The community size variables explain only 1.2
percent of the variation in tolerance toward right-
ists and 2.6 percent of that toward leftists (i.e.,
increments in R? attributable to the community-
size variables entered in a final regression step
are .012 and .026, respectively). In comparison,
education and age — important determinants of
tolerance both theoretically and empirically —
have far greater impacts on tolerance. Education
explains 4.2 percent and 6.7 percent of variation
in tolerance in the respective analyses, and age

explains 2.8 percent and 3.8 percent (as indicat-
ed by the squared part correlations; increments
to R? attributable to education are .042 and .067
respectively, and to age are .028 and .038).

I argue that these results do not adequately
document a modest effect of urbanism on toler-
ance. The community-size measures provide only
incomplete information on the urban experience
of most respondents in the national sample.
However, they do fully reflect urban experience
for respondents with constant urban experience
(type 1) and may still prove to have a consider-
able effect on tolerance among that group. Re-
sults of an analysis restricted to type | respondents
are presented on the right side of Table 2. Be-
cause type 1 respondents are nonmigrants whose
present and origin community sizes are identical,
migration status and present community size are
excluded from the analysis.

The community-size variables are again sig-
nificantly related to greater tolerance and the ef-
fect of community size is more marked. Com-
munity-size variables explain 3.7 percent of the
variation in tolerance toward rightists and 6.1
percent of the variation in tolerance toward left-
ists (based on increments to R?). Furthermore, the
explanatory power of community size surpasses
that of age — according to the squared part cor-
relations, age explains 2.5 percent and 3.8 percent
of the variation in tolerance toward rightists and
leftists, respectively — and roughly equals that
of education (4.5 percent and 5.6 percent, re-
spectively). Among those for whom available
community-size measures adequately tap urban
experience (type | respondents), urban experience
exerts a considerable effect on tolerance.®

The left side of Table 2 shows that being a
migrant is independently and directly related to
greater tolerance toward both rightist and leftist
groups. Table 3 reports regressions of tolerance
on dummy variables corresponding to urban ex-
perience types. Size of origin community and the
personal characteristics are included ds controls
(although coefficients for personal characteristics
are not shown). As expected, migration to larger

® This interpretation is supported by additional evi-
dence. First, I compared the variability of variables
between type | respondents and the balance of the
sample (type 2), and found only minor dissimilarities
that could not explain these findings. Second, I was
unable to replicate the relatively strong urban effects
found for type | respondents among any of the type 2
subtypes, suggesting that the robust effects for type 1
resulted from size measure’s better reflection of ur-
ban experience for that group. Details of these pro-
cedures are available on request from the author.
communities is independently related to greater
tolerance for both rightists and leftists. Contrary
to past findings, however, migration to smaller
communities and migration between same-sized
communities are also related to greater tolerance
although not as strongly. Lifelong residence in a
growing community (type 2a) is related to great-
er tolerance toward leftists but not rightists, while
lifelong residence in a declining community (type
2b) retards tolerance.
cial heterogeneity. Consistent with Stouffer, on
the other hand, is a weaker but significant posi-
tive effect associated with migration to smaller
communities. Contrary to both Wirth and
Stouffer, migration between communities of the
same size also promotes tolerance, though
weakly. Together, the findings imply that en-
counters with alien ways of life — what Stouffer
called “culture shock” and what Wirth expected
to be primarily an urban phenomenon- promote
tolerance. However, this effect is likely to be
experienced to at least some degree by any mi-
grant, regardless of size of destination.

Modest effects of community-size measures
on tolerance were found among a national sam-
ple, but far stronger effects were found among a
subsample for whom the size measures ade-
quately reflected urban experience. That urban
tolerance is extended to both rightist and leftist
groups implies that it is content free (cf. Marcus,
Piereson, and Sullivan 1980). At least for my
subsample, the claim that urbanism’s effects on
personality are modest underestimates the true
relationship. Although the “true” effect of ur-
banism among the population generally may not
be as strong as found in my subsample, studies
using conventional operationalizations of urban-
ism are clearly limited in their ability to assess
urbanism’s impact on tolerance.
