During the past decade, social movement
scholars have returned to a topic that has
long been of interest in the field: the policing
of public protest events. The resurgence of
interest in this topic has generated new the-
ory (e.g., Della Porta and Reiter 1998; Earl
and Soule 2006), new datasets and measures
of protest policing (e.g., Davenport and Eads
2001; Earl and Soule 2006; Koopmans 1997;
Kriesi et al. 1995; White 1999; Wisler and
Giugni 1999), and new modeling techniques
(e.g., Earl and Soule 2010; Earl, Soule, and
McCarthy 2003).

At a substantive level, this work largely
confirms much of what we know from the
broader literature on why states repress
How does the race of protesters affect how police respond to protest events? Drawing on the
protest policing literature and on theories of race and ethnic relations, we explore the idea
that police view African American protesters as especially threatening and that this threat
leads to a greater probability of policing. We examine more than 15,000 protest events that
took place in the United States between 1960 and 1990 and find that in many years, African
American protest events are more likely than white protest events to draw police presence
and that once at events, police are more likely to take action at African American protest
events. Additional analyses complicate these findings by showing that they vary over time.
In many years, for example, African American protest events are no more likely than white
protest events to be policed. While there is support for a “Protesting While Black” phenom-
enon, it is not invariant across the entire period of inquiry.
Gurr 1970; Hibbs 1973; Poe and Tate 1994;
Tilly 1978). We also know that behavioral
threats posed by demonstrators at a given pro-
test event are an important predictor of the
type and extent of protest policing (Earl
et al. 2003), just as these threats predict state
efforts to control dissidents more broadly
(Davenport 1995, 2007; Moore 1998). For
example, Earl and Soule (2006) argue con-
vincingly that to fully understand why and
how protest is policed, we need to understand
exactly what aspects of a given protest event
are considered to be threatening to the actors
charged with making decisions in specific
protest situations, as well as what aspects of
an event are threatening to the broader politi-
cal authorities who generally guide the param-
eters within which police can act.

In line with this literature and a recent sug-
gestion by Oliver (2008) that scholars of
social movements attend to the dynamics of
race and crime, this article seeks to advance
the protest policing literature by assessing
the impact of protesters’ race on police
response. Why do this? The behavioral threat
tradition has identified many characteristics of
protest events that are likely to be met with
various types of policing, yet this work has
not seriously looked at protesters’ race as
something that might affect police behavior.
We find this puzzling given the voluminous
literature on how African Americans have
been treated in the broader criminal justice
system.' Drawing on research on systemic
racism (e.g., Bonilla-Silva 2001; Feagin
2000, 2006), group threat (e.g., Blalock
1967; Blauner 1971; Blumer 1958), and com-
petition theory (e.g., Olzak 1992), we argue
that protesters’ race is a critical piece of infor-
mation that policing agents have at their dis-
posal when deciding how to respond. Accord-
ing to these literatures, when minority racial
groups (in our case, African Americans) are
mobilized in political claims-making, they
are perceived as threatening to the dominant
group (in our case, whites). We find it striking
that the extant literature on protest policing,
and in particular the literature focusing on
the different kinds of threat protesters pose
to authorities, has scarcely picked up on this
point.

To address this omission, we use data on
more than 15,000 protest events that took
place in the United States between 1960 and
1990. Controlling for multiple measures of
threat (e.g., size of the event and use of vio-
lence by protesters), we find that when com-
pared with other groups, African American
protesters are more likely to draw police pres-
ence and that once police are present they are
more likely to make arrests, use force and vio-
lence, and use force and violence in combina-
tion with arrests at African American protest
events. That is, we find support for a ‘‘Protest-
ing While Black” phenomenon, just as others
have found a “Driving While Black” phe-
nomenon (e.g., Eitle et al. 2002; Harris
1999; Smith and Albert 2002). However, we
also find that these effects are not uniform
across the entire period of inquiry. Specifi-
cally, the effects are strongest prior to the pas-
sage of key civil rights legislation in the mid-
1960s, suggesting there is a certain degree of
over-time variability in police response to
African American protest events.
police-protester interactions (i.e., protest
policing) and scholars began to collect spe-
cific information on protest activity, inspired
by the pioneering work of Tilly (e.g., 1969,
1978, 2003). As a result, scholars began to
routinely collect information on types and
level of violence used by protesters (Earl
et al. 2003), numbers of participants at events
(e.g., Earl and Soule 2006, 2010; Earl et al.
2003; Francisco 1996), degree of organiza-
tion (Earl et al. 2003), and tactics used by
protesters (Davenport and Eads 2001; Earl
et al. 2003). This information was coupled
with specific details about how police
responded to protesters, such as whether
police showed up at an event, the degree of
violence police used, and whether arrests
were made (Earl et al. 2003; Francisco
1996). Findings from this research are clear
and remarkably consistent: police are more
likely to act (and to act in an aggressive man-
ner) when protesters are violent, numerous,
directly challenging political authorities,
organized, and using multiple or innovative
tactics. This body of work is known as the
threat (e.g., Earl et al. 2003) or behavioral
threat (e.g., Soule and Davenport 2009)
model of protest policing.

Cumulatively, the threat model has
advanced our understanding of protest polic-
ing, especially by paying explicit attention to
how the police and other government agents
consider protesters’ behavior (and to a lesser
extent ideological challenges) as they contem-
plate how to respond. For the most part, how-
ever, this research ignores the race of protest-
ers—something that in and of itself may be
perceived as threatening to state and political
authorities.

To date, only two studies examine how the
race of protesters may affect policing of rele-
vant events (Earl and Soule 2006; Earl et al.
2003). These studies differ from our analysis
in two important ways. First, these works
argue that protesters’ minority group status
signals to authorities a weakness that can be
exploited when considering whom to police
and when. According to this argument, police
may be more likely to respond aggressively to
minority group protests because they believe
they can get away with it (ie., minority
groups have fewer resources, are less orga-
nized, and are less likely to retaliate or to
hold authorities accountable). This is a funda-
mentally different argument from what we
propose here; we focus not on the weakness
of minority groups, but on how they are per-
ceived as threatening to authorities in general
and to officers at a particular event. Second,
these works do not disaggregate their measure
of minority group status; instead, they include
a composite measure of “‘the unemployed, the
poor, gays and lesbians, the homeless, Mus-
lims, and [sic] racial and ethnic groups except
for undifferentiated whites, Italians, other
European nationalities, and the Jewish”
(Earl and Soule 2006:160). We argue that
there are important historical and theoretical
reasons for treating African Americans as
a specific minority group that might be espe-
cially likely to be policed, and policed
heavily.
a straightforward instance of a “hierarchical
interaction” (Feagin 2000:21) between an
oppressed group and its oppressor. In such
instances, whites and institutions they control
(e.g., the police force) will react swiftly and
harshly because such claims-making threatens
the ideological white supremacist project that
is characteristic of systemic racism (Feagin
2000). Historical research on early African
American resistance and  claims-making
(e.g., Slave revolts, insurrections, rebellions,
work slow-downs, and sabotage) shows that,
in an attempt to control these efforts, whites
have nearly always applied various forms of
coercion, ranging from verbal harassment,
sexual predation, torture, and lynching to
slave codes, black codes, and Jim Crow laws
(Aptheker 1943; Franklin and Starr 1967;
Wilson 1978). While not all of these forms
of sociopolitical control are carried out by
police, the systemic racism literature argues
that the criminal justice system, which is con-
trolled by whites, has frequently been used to
control claims-making efforts by African
Americans (Feagin 2000, 2006).

Similarly, the racial threat and ethnic com-
petition literatures are used extensively to
examine how the relative size of the African
American population affects various facets
of the criminal justice system. For example,
scholarship associated with this approach
finds that an increase in the relative size of
the black population (the usual proxy for
threat) increases the amount of resources pro-
vided to the criminal justice system (Jackson
and Caroll 1981; Jacobs and Helms 1999;
Stults and Baumer 2007), arrest and incarcer-
ation rates of blacks (Greenberg and West
2001; Jacobs and Carmichael 2001; Liska
and Chamlin 1984; Liska, Lawrence, and
Benson 1981; Myers 1990), African American
police stops and searches (Engel 2008; Office
of the Attorney General 1999; Smith and
Petrocelli 2001; Zingraff et al. 2000), police
killings of African Americans (Jacobs and
O’Brien 1998), and complaints about police
brutality (Holmes 2000; Holmes and Smith
2008). Moreover, it is not just these formal
methods of social control that seem to be
sparked by increases in the relative size of
the black population, but also extra-legal
forms such as attacks, lynching, and vandal-
ism (Olzak 1992; Soule 1992; Soule and
Van Dyke 1999; Tolnay and Beck 1995).

To the insights from these three literatures,
we add that the rich literature on police and
police organization itself sheds light on why
we expect police to respond differently (and
more harshly) to African American protest.
At the level of police organization, scholars
have long noted that police embody the objec-
tives of the broader political-economic elite;
the goal of protecting the status quo is instilled
within each class of police recruits through
training and socialization (Bennis and Namus
1985; Chambliss 2001; Shrafritz and Ott
1992; Smith and Holmes 2003) and is rein-
forced through policies and practices of the
police structure (Bennett 1984; Johnson
2003; Klockars, Ivokovich, and Haberfeld
2004). Similarly, the police have a distinct
subculture that governs individual officers’
day-to-day behaviors and emphasizes the
“shared group interests of those responsible
for protecting society from its wrongdoers”
(Holmes and Smith 2008:25). The culture of
policing is such that rookie officers quickly
learn to protect elite interests and to empha-
size the boundary between those who make
and enforce the laws and those who may
threaten them. In the American context, the
former are historically whites, the latter are
historically African Americans (Holmes and
Smith 2008).4

Beyond the character of police organiza-
tion, the policing literature points to the fact
that there may be something specific about
individual police officers or citizens that is
relevant to the differential protest policing of
American protesters, and African American
protesters in particular. One tradition of schol-
arship examines a number of individual-level
characteristics of officers (e.g., race, degree
of prejudice, and personality type) and citi-
zens (e.g., race and demeanor) and attempts
to connect these to the probability of using
force against subordinate groups (see review
in Holmes and Smith [2008]). More recent
scholarship focuses on the values, beliefs,
and opinions of individual police officers as
they relate to subordinate groups. For exam-
ple, research has found that police officers
generally view African Americans as more
likely to be engaged in criminal activity and
violence (Anderson 1990; Hurwitz and
Peffley 1997; Schuman et al. 1997), more
likely to be carrying weapons (Greenwald,
Oakes, and Hoffman 2003), and more likely
to show disrespect for police authority (Engel
2003). Accordingly, this work finds that
police are more likely to treat African Amer-
icans coercively and aggressively.

Based on these various findings, we argue
that there are many reasons to expect African
American protests to be policed more heavily
than other protests. Our strategy for analysis,
described in detail in the following section,
is to compare African American protest with
protest by other groups. We ask whether oth-
erwise equally threatening protest events are
more likely to be policed when there are Afri-
can American participants present. In other
words, our analysis attempts to see if race
affects the probability of various policing
strategies above and beyond the threats posed
by protester behavior.

Based on the systemic racism, racial threat,
and competition arguments, we expect to find
evidence supportive of Protesting While
Black, evidence that will be robust across his-
torical time, given the enduring nature of
American racism. At the same time, we
believe that the historical record shows that
African American protest events changed dra-
matically from 1960 to 1990, with respect to
the substantive issues concerning African
Americans (Marable 1991) and how the state
viewed African American claims-making
(Goldstein 1978). We conduct additional anal-
yses designed to look at any over-time
changes in the differences between the polic-
ing of African American and white protest
events.
Our unit of analysis is the protest event (or
“event”’), which we define as any type of
activity that involves more than one person
and is carried out with the explicit purpose
of articulating a grievance against (or
expressing support for) a target. While the
larger project from which we draw our data
includes information on a variety of different
tactics used at protest events, we focus here
on events that used tactics that might draw
police presence or lead to police action
once they arrived. The events we examine
include rallies, demonstrations, marches, vig-
ils, picketing, civil disobedience, ceremonial
events, motorcades, dramaturgical demon-
strations, symbolic displays, riots, mob vio-
lence, and attacks.> We drew data on these
events from daily editions of the New York
Times (NYT) between 1960 and 1990; these
data come from the Dynamics of Collective
Action Project’ run by Sarah Soule, Susan
Olzak, John McCarthy, and Doug McAdam.’

For a particular protest event to be included
in the dataset, it must meet three basic criteria.
First, there must be more than one participant
at the event, because our interest is in collec-
tive action. Acts of protest carried out by indi-
viduals, such as uncoordinated hunger strikes
or acts of self-immolation, are therefore not
included. Second, participants at an event
must articulate a claim, whether this is a griev-
ance against or an expression of support for
a target. The events in the dataset are associ-
ated with any claim or issue area articulated
by participants (i.e., these are not specific to
a particular movement or set of movements).
While claims can often be grouped into dis-
tinct social movements or issue areas, the cod-
ing team did not attempt to do this a priori.
Because the coding rules required that
protesters articulate a claim, collective events
such as block parties, annual parades, and
fundraising campaigns were not coded.’ Fur-
thermore, the event must have happened in
the public sphere or have been open to the
public for the coding team to include it in their
dataset. Private or closed meetings by social
movement actors are not included, but events
within organizations (e.g., schools, churches,
and private organizations) are included if
they were open to the public.!° Finally, coded
events occurred all over the United States.!!

These data were collected in two distinct
stages. First, researchers read every page of
all daily issues of the NYT, searching for
any mention of protest events. By not using
an index to the NYT, we found events that
were embedded in articles on other (often
related) topics. For example, we found protest
events by poor people embedded in more gen-
eral articles on the cost of living. It is likely
that such events would not be indexed under
headings such as “protest” or ‘“‘demonstra-
tion.” As a result, our strategy nets a greater
number of events than would other strategies.
The second stage of data collection involved
content coding each event; a single article
can discuss multiple events, each of which
we coded separately. Project personnel coded
information on a variety of different topics,
including the claim or issue area articulated
at the event, event size and location, the par-
ticipating groups, targets of the event, organi-
zational presence, tactical forms employed,
and police presence and action taken at the
event. Inter-coder reliability estimates for
most items on the code sheet were consis-
tently at or above 90 percent agreement.
Overall, there are 15,055 protest events
reported to have occurred in the United States
between 1960 and 1990 that used the tactics
described earlier.’
protest, in large part because they allow for
the collection of large numbers of events,
emphasizing social movements’ dynamic
activities over the more static. McAdam
and Su (2002:704) note that analysis of pro-
test event data culled from newspapers is
a ‘‘methodological staple’? in social move-
ment studies and that many of the ‘‘classical
empirical works in the field’’ use newspaper
data.

Because so many scholars use newspaper
data, there have been many attempts to assess
the potential biases associated with this
source. Recent reviews have identified two
chief types of possible bias—description bias
and selection bias (Earl et al. 2004; Davenport
2010; Oliver and Maney 2000; Oliver and
Myers 1999; Ortiz et al. 2005). Description
bias refers to how well (or how poorly)
a newspaper reporter describes what actually
happened at a given event. Most attempts to
assess this source of bias conclude that the
“hard facts” of an event are generally accu-
rately covered by newspapers. Because we
draw on the hard facts of events (as we will
describe in detail, we use data on tactics
used, goals articulated, organizations present,
and policing) and not on soft facts (e.g., opin-
ions on the issue), we are confident that the
accuracy of our data is acceptable for our pur-
poses here.

Selection bias refers to the fact that not all
protest events will be covered by a given
newspaper and the possibility that what is
covered is likely not a random sample of all
events that took place. Literature on selection
bias notes that more intense events (e.g.,
larger, more violent, or injurious events),
events with conflict or significant actors
(e.g., celebrities or individuals defined as
powerful or culturally legitimate), and events
proximate to a newspaper’s headquarters are
more likely to be selected for coverage
(Davenport 2010; Ortiz et al. 2005).

We believe, for a number of reasons, that
these possible biases do not affect our results
in any major way. Some of these reasons are
related to the data collection efforts of the
team that collected the data; others are related
to statistical controls and sensitivity analyses
that we performed for this article. We address
each in turn.

First, as noted earlier, unlike many prior
studies using newspapers as a source of data
on collective action events, the project team
responsible for collecting these data did not
use an index of the NYT to identify events,
nor did they sample days of the newspaper.
Instead, researchers reviewed daily editions
of the newspaper and identified all collective
action events that were reported, after which
research assistants content-coded each event.
While it admittedly took a long time, this
strategy helped reduce the selection bias that
may be introduced by indexing methodology
and day-of-the-week rhythms in coverage
(Earl et al. 2004; Ortiz et al. 2005). Moreover,
this approach allowed researchers to find
many less intense and smaller events that
were embedded in articles on larger, more
intense events. For example, it was not
uncommon to find mention of a small, related
event in a locale far from New York described
in an article on an event that took place in or
around New York.

Second, our analysis includes controls for
other common sources of selection bias (e.g.,
disruptive tactics, violence, event size, and
proximity to the news source). Furthermore,
we conducted a number of analyses designed
to examine how selection bias might affect
our results. Specifically, we randomly selected
10, 20, and 30 percent of all intense events
(i.e., defined as events where there was vio-
lence, events that were larger than average,
and events that involved property damage)
and dropped them from the analysis. The logic
of this strategy is that if newspapers over-
report intense events and we randomly remove
some of these intense events, we ought to dis-
cem whether over-reporting of this sort is
affecting our results. Even when we remove
30 percent of intense events randomly, we
obtain the same general patterns we report
here. Although we are unable to assess over-
reporting of intense events in actuality, these
simulations give us greater confidence that
we are reporting general trends that hold,
even when we assume there is fairly severe
over-reporting of intense events.

Finally, it seems reasonable to ask how
data on African American protest, and police
response to it, collected from the NYT might
differ from data collected from black newspa-
pers. Recent attempts to examine this issue
(i.e., Davenport 2010; Weiner 2009) indicate
that the NYT (like other elite, national news-
papers) is less likely to cover African Ameri-
can protest and, when it does, is less likely to
report details on police repression. By con-
trast, black, radical, and alternative presses
are more likely to cover contentious events
and the details of police response. While it
is beyond the scope of the present study to
provide a direct comparison of the NYT and
black newspapers, based on Weiner’s and
Davenport’s studies, we believe our findings
are likely a conservative estimate of the differ-
ences between the policing of African Amer-
ican and white protest. We expect our findings
would be amplified if we used newspaper data
from black newspapers.
Our core goal is to ascertain whether, all
things being equal, African American protest
events are more likely than other events to be
policed. Our first order of business is thus to
include measures of a variety of factors
shown by past research to increase the prob-
ability of policing. To do this, we include
a set of eight variables shown to influence
the likelihood of protest policing.’

The first of these measures is the size of
a protest event measured by the number of
participants (logged), because event size has
been shown to increase the probability of
police presence and action (Earl et al. 2003;
Soule and Davenport 2009). The logic here
is that larger events are more threatening to
police because these events identify a larger
number of aggrieved individuals, are more
difficult to control, present more opportunities
for violation of laws, and harbor a greater
potential to harm police officers present at
the event. In our dataset, a specific number
of protesters were reported in a news article
for about 51 percent of events. In the remain-
ing 49 percent of events, coders were asked to
estimate the number of protesters based on
verbal cues in the article (e.g., coders placed
“small,” ‘“‘few,” or a ‘‘handful” of protesters
in category 1).!° For events in which specific
numbers of protesters were not reported, we
imputed a number by choosing the midpoint
of each category.'®

Second, we include a dummy variable for
whether counter-demonstrators were present
at an event. We include this variable because
past research shows that the presence of
counter-demonstrators increases the probabil-
ity of conflict at an event because of the
potential for hostile interactions between
them and protesters. This increases the level
of threat to police agents and, in turn, the like-
lihood of repression (Earl and Soule 2006;
Waddington 1994). In our data, 6 percent of
events had counter-demonstrators present.

We include six additional variables related
to what kinds of arguably threatening things
protesters do at a given event, all of which
have been shown to increase the probability
of policing. The first of these is a dichotomous
variable coded 1 when protesters used
extremely confrontational tactics (e.g.,
attacks, riots, melees, and mob violence).
Between 1960 and 1990, protesters used
such tactics at 16 percent of the events in
our dataset. The second variable is also
dichotomous, coded 1 when protesters
employed less confrontational tactics (e.g.,
civil disobedience, demonstrations, and ral-
lies). Protesters used such tactics in 71 percent
of events during this period. The third mea-
sure is a dichotomous variable coded 1 when
protesters damaged property at an event. Dur-
ing this period, protesters damaged property at
about 10 percent of the events in our data. Our
fourth measure of threat is tactical variety,
which ranges from 1 to 4 and is a count of
the number of different protest tactics used
by protesters. We include this measure
because research shows that policing of fewer
tactics is easier than policing of multiple tac-
tics (Davenport 1995; Soule and Davenport
2009; Ziegenhagen 1986). When protesters
use greater numbers of tactics, authorities
are confronted with a more complex scenario
and are forced to improvise and employ per-
sonnel with greater variation in training and
preparation—dynamics that frequently lead
to greater levels of police aggression. Our fifth
measure is protester use of violence at an
event, something that nearly always draws
police presence and action (Earl et al. 2003).
We include a dummy variable that is coded
1 when protesters used physical violence,
state.

Once these eight variables are included, we
then include a dummy variable that is coded 1
when at least some of the participants at an
event were African American.'7 From 1960
to 1990, 3,829 events (or 25 percent of the
events in our data) had African American par-
ticipants. As Figure 1 shows, there is a great
deal of variation in this over the time period.
For example, over 60 percent of events
reported in the New York Times in 1963 had
African Americans present. Whereas the pro-
portion of African Americans at events
remains disproportionately high (given the
size of the African American population)
throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s, we
see a steady decline following this peak year.

One of the unique facets of our analysis is
that we are able to measure protesters’ race
(as reported by the New York Times) and
include this as a key independent variable.
One of the criticisms of the racial threat and
competition literatures is that measurement
of threat is usually inferred from the relative
size of the subordinate group, rather than
directly measured (see reviews in Stults and
Baumer [2007] and Holmes and Smith
[2008]). This is true whether one is arguing
that this group poses a political (Olzak 1992;
Soule 1992; Soule and Van Dyke 1999), eco-
nomic (Olzak 1992; Tolnay and Beck 1995),
or physical challenge (Lizotte and Bordua
1980).'® By adopting our approach to opera-
tionalization, we are able to better specify
subordinate group threat because we are
examining the effect of a specific political
action enacted by a racial group; we see
how this influences the behavior of agents
who are directly responsible for meting out
social control at the site of the political threat.
That is, we examine the effect of protesters’
race on how police handle a given protest
event, net of the effects of any behavioral
threat posed by these protesters.’

Because of the possibility of a regional
bias with respect to the data source (New
York Times, see note 11), in all models we
include a dummy variable that is coded 1
when an event took place in the state of
New York. Finally, we include a dummy
variable that is coded 1 when an event
took place in the South to control for the
unique history of racial discrimination and
over-policing of Southern civil rights events
in the 1960s.
conservative estimation of our models’ stan-
dard errors. Neither the glm() routine or the
multinom() routine used to estimate models
calculates clustered standard errors either by
default or by argument. To accomplish this,
we modified code developed by Chiba
(2009) to produce the appropriate standard
errors after the models were estimated. The
R code to produce the clustered standard errors
and all of the other results in this article are
available in the online supplement (http://asr.
sagepub.com/supplemental). Table 1 presents
these models.

Second, once we have examined the pre-
dictors of police presence at a protest event,
we then examine three different policing
strategies, conditional on police presence:
(1) making arrests, (2) using force/violence,
and (3) making arrests and using force/
violence together. In this second analysis
(presented in Table 2), we use multinomial
logistic regression analysis, treating police
doing nothing as the reference category.”!
We estimate these models using the multi-
nom() function in the nnet package in R.
For all models in Tables 1 and 2, we present
the odds ratios (rather than coefficient esti-
mates). The odds ratio represents the odds
of observing a given police strategy (i.e.,
police use of physical force/violence, pres-
ence, or arrests) at a given event versus
not observing the particular strategy. An
odds ratio for a particular independent vari-
able with a value higher than 1| indicates an
increase in the odds associated with a one
unit increase in the particular explanatory
variable. An odds ratio for a particular inde-
pendent variable between 0 and 1 indicates
a decrease in the odds associated with
a one unit increase in the particular explan-
atory variable.

In both sets of analysis, we add an inves-
tigation of how the effects vary over time.
For example, readers may be curious about
the possibility that the effects are driven
by particularities of policing associated
with the civil rights era, during which time
African Americans engaged in unprece-
dented levels of protest, principally directed
toward bringing attention to discrimination
against African Americans and the lack of
progress in their integration (Branch 1988).
Other readers may wonder if, during the
late 1960s and early 1970s, policing of Afri-
can Americans grew more intense with the
need to control the urban riots in many
USS. cities or with the growth of the black
power movement. Readers may also be curi-
ous about the 1970s and 1980s, when Afri-
can American protest was much more lim-
ited in frequency relative to that of other
groups (see Figure 1).

Unfortunately, there is no simple and
straightforward way to examine historical

time because it is possible that by arbitrarily
imposing some time structure (e.g., analyzing
relationships with a dummy variable for the
civil rights era or splitting the analysis into
different broad, historical periods), we could
inaccurately identify a relationship that does
not really exist. Thus, to examine any over-
time changes in the differential treatment of
African American and white protest, we
use a B-spline with knots at 1960, 1970,
1980, and 1990 (Keele 2008). This
approach fits cubic functions between the
knots, subject to the constraint that they
are forced to join smoothly at the knots.
We accomplished this in R using the bs()
function in the splines package (R Develop-
ment Core Team 2010). This model uses rel-
atively few degrees of freedom, but as will
become apparent, it allows an enormous
amount of flexibility in the detection of rela-
tionships. Another advantage of this
approach is that the splines can be modeled
simply as variables in conventional regres-
sion models, as we do here. In Tables 1
and 2, we include the splines and then, in
Table 3, we present an analysis of how
events with and without an African Ameri-
can presence were treated by the police
each year (holding all other variables in
the statistical models at their mean values).
monitoring of most African American protest.
The gap is also striking in 1977, when nearly
75 percent of African American events drew
police presence, while only a quarter of white
events did so. In 1977, there were large riots in
Chicago, as well as riots associated with the
blackout in New York City; we thus expect
similar dynamics (albeit of a lower magnitude)
were in order in this year as in 1967.

Figure 2 suggests that, in general, African
American protest events were more likely to
be policed. While compelling, this does not
tell us anything about what happened at spe-
cific protest events that might make police
more likely to respond and, in some cases,
respond heavily. The figure does not tell us
if police were responding to the race of the
participants or to some set of behavioral
threats. To address these issues, we turn to
our multivariate analysis.”

As noted earlier, we first examine the odds
of police presence at a protest event (see
Table 1). Next, we examine the odds of three
different policing strategies, given that police
have shown up at an event (compared with
the reference category of police doing noth-
ing, once at an event): (1) making arrests,
(2) using force/violence, or (3) making arrests
in conjunction with using force/violence (see
Table 2). In each case, we estimate two differ-
ent model specifications—one where a dummy
variable representing the presence of African
Americans at an event and the splines repre-
senting time are included as the main effects
only, and another where the dummy variable
representing African American presence is
interacted with the splines.

Results in Models 1 and 2 in Table 1 show
striking continuity. We find that nearly all of
the threat factors shown in previous research
to increase policing are significant in our
models. Specifically, the models reveal that
protester use of violence and property damage
are likely to bring police to an event. Police
are also likely to appear at events where pro-
testers use multiple tactics and events where
protesters target the government. The odds
of police presence also increase when
counter-demonstrators are present. Finally,
when protesters use confrontational or
extremely confrontational tactics, the odds of
police presence increase. There is one excep-
tion to these strikingly consistent findings:
protest size has no significant effect on police
presence.”4

The more novel part of our story, however,
is with respect to African American protest
events. Models 1 and 2 show that African
American protest events are more likely to
draw police presence, even when we control
for the measures of behavioral threat
described earlier. In short, the results pre-
sented in Table 1 lend support to Protesting
While Black. African American presence
can be interpreted as increasing the odds of
police presence in Model 1, but not in Model
2 because the effect of African American
presence is conditional on the nonlinear time
effect. Closer investigation of this effect
shows that African American events were
more likely to draw police presence in the
years 1961 to 1982, inclusive.”>

What do police do, once they are present at
protest events? After they have arrived, do
they treat African American protesters differ-
ently than white protesters? An examination
of Table 2 reveals some interesting differen-
ces with respect to the types of policing,
once police have arrived at an event.

The multinomial logistic regression models
(with splines) shown in Table 2 reveal a simi-
lar consistency as do Models 1 and 2. Model 3
includes the main effect of African American
presence and the time splines (along with the
controls); Model 4 includes interactions
between the splines and the African American
presence variable. Note that the omnibus test
for splines indicates that the B-spline coeffi-
cients are jointly significant, hence there is
an interesting nonlinear temporal trend.”
The omnibus test for spline interactions shows
that the interactions between the B-splines and
the African American presence dummy are
jointly significant. This indicates that at
some times, certain tactics are statistically
more likely to be used in events where

African Americans are present. We discuss
this finding in more detail below.

First, and most central to our chief goal
here, Table 2 shows that once police arrive
at an event with African Americans present,
they are more likely to make arrests, to use
force/violence, and to use force/violence in
conjunction with arrests than they are to do
nothing, although only the last of these out-
comes is significantly more likely. These find-
ings are directly in line with Protesting While
Black.””

With respect to the various threat varia-
bles, we see that police are less likely to
make arrests (only) than they are to do noth-
ing at larger events. But, they are more
likely to use force/violence, either alone or
in conjunction with arrests, than they are
to do nothing at these larger events. These
findings hint at the possibility that at large
events, police exercise restraint, unless an
event gets out of control, at which point,
police act with all means necessary to con-
trol the event.

When counter-demonstrators are present,
police are less likely to make arrests or to
use force/violence in conjunction with arrests
than they are to do nothing, but they are
slightly more likely to use force (than to
do nothing). This interesting pattern is dif-
ferent than the pattern described earlier
with respect to property damage. It appears
that counter-demonstrator presence signals
to police that a forceful response may be
necessary, but that arrests (either alone or
used in conjunction with force/violence)
are not appropriate. One reason for this
may be that at such events, police cannot
reliably determine who should be arrested,
thus they are more likely to resort to force/
violence or to do nothing.

With respect to protesters’ tactics, when
protesters use violence, police are more likely
to use force/violence either alone or in combi-
nation with arrests than they are to do nothing.
Police are also more likely to make arrests
(either with or without also using force/
violence) to control protesters (than they are
to do nothing) when protesters use multiple
tactics. These findings suggest that extremely
confrontational tactics, use of violence, and
use of multiple tactics are triggers for various
kinds of police response, as the behavioral
threat hypothesis predicts.

The multinomial logistic regression models
presented in Table 2 show some interesting
differences in patterns of protest policing
with respect to the effects of our various threat
variables. Model 3 also shows that, with
respect to the policing of African American
protesters, police are always more likely to
use force and violence than they are to do
nothing. Again, this is consistent with Protest-
ing While Black. This is the most important
finding in Table 2, as it adds to what we
know about the predictors of protest policing
in important ways.

Do these findings hold in all years in the
analysis? Because of the conditional effect
of African American presence in Model 4
(see Table 2), the effect of African Ameri-
can presence cannot be directly interpreted;
instead, we can use Table 3, which
shows the predicted probability that African
Americans are more likely to experience
a particular police strategy in a given year.
Including the splines with knots in this
model allows us to examine how these pat-
terns differ from year to year. Table 3 shows
the difference in the probability of each out-
come for events where African Americans
were present versus those where African
Americans were not present. Again, values
smaller than .025 indicate the outcome is
significantly (with 95 percent confidence)
more likely when African Americans
are not present and values greater than
.975 indicate the outcome is significantly
more likely when African Americans are
present. Specifically, cell entries in this
table are the simulated p-values for the dif-
ferences in the predicted probabilities of
each of the given policing strategies
between African American and white pro-
test events (holding all other variables in
Table 2 at their means).

Note: Cell entries are the simulated p-values for differences in the predicted probabilities of each type of
policing for African American and white protesters (holding all other variables in Table 2 at their mean
values). Bold numbers (i.e., those greater than .975 for a two-tailed test) indicate that the model predicts
the type of policing was significantly more likely to be experienced by African American protesters in
that year than by whites. Italicized numbers (i.e., those smaller than .025 for a two-tailed test) indicate
that the model predicts the type of policing was significantly more likely to be experienced by white
protesters than by African Americans in that year.
Table 3 shows a number of interesting
results.2* Only in the early period of the data
are the police significantly more likely to do
nothing when African Americans are not pres-
ent, specifically from 1960 to 1971. This find-
ing is in line with Protesting While Black.
From 1983 to 1989, police were actually sig-
nificantly more likely to do nothing at protest
events where African Americans were pres-
ent. During this later period, the Protesting
1989, however, arrests were more likely at
events without African American protesters.
Model 4 in Table 3 also indicates that police
are rarely more likely to use force (without
also using arrests) as a function of the protest-
ers’ race (only in 1960). Finally, as discussed
earlier, Table 3 indicates that from 1960 to
1971, events with African Americans present
were more likely to be subject to arrests and
force/violence.

These findings add nuance to results
reported in Table 2. In that table, we found
that African American protesters were more
likely to be arrested and subjected to force/
violence (than to have police do nothing).
Here, we find this to be the case only from
1960 to 1970. We also find that arrests were
more likely to be used in events with African
Americans present from 1960 to 1962 and,
importantly, that white protesters were actu-
ally more likely to be arrested in the 1982 to
1989 period. During this latter period, anti-
abortion activists (e.g., Operation Rescue)
and AIDS/HIV activists (e.g, ACT UP)
staged many protests that were met with
arrests. While African Americans were cer-
tainly active in these movements, they drew
more heavily from the white population.

Table 3 also shows that events taking place
between 1960 and 1971 were more likely to
be met with police force/violence in conjunc-
tion with arrests when there were African
American protesters in attendance; that is,
during this time, African American protest
events were more likely to be met with the
full range of police action. After this period,
however, there are no significant differences
between African American and white protest
events. Again, this finding adds nuance to
results presented in Table 2 by showing that
much of the effects are driven by the early
part of our period, prior to important civil
rights legislative victories and police reform
in the late 1960s.

Cumulatively viewing our results, we find
there is, in fact, a Protesting While Black phe-
nomenon, but it is historically bounded and it
depends on what kind of policing we are
This article explores the effect of protesters’
race on police response to protest in the
United States. Examining more than 15,000
protest events (reported in the New York
Times) from 1960 to 1990 and controlling
for various threatening characteristics of pro-
test events (e.g., size, protester violence,
presence of counter-demonstrators, and tacti-
cal use), we first find that African American
protesters were more likely than white protest-
ers to have police monitor their events. Next,
we examine whether, once at an event, police
treated African American and white protesters
differently. In this second analysis, we again
find that African American protesters were
more likely than white protesters to be met
with police action. Our final analysis explores
differences over the time period with respect
to these findings. Here, we find some intrigu-
ing over-time patterns in the differential pro-
test policing of African American and white
protest events. Most important, we find that
at African American protest events, police
were more likely to use force/violence in con-
junction with arrests or to use arrests only
prior to the early 1970s. In short, we find sup-
port for a Protesting While Black phenome-
non, but we also find that it varies over time.

Results of our study dovetail with research
in various subfields of the social sciences.
First, while our research design cannot discern
if the disproportionate policing of African
American protest events (in some years) is
due to racism on the part of individual police
officers, we believe that the literature on the
implicit bias of law enforcement agents
(e.g., Correll et al. 2002; Eberhardt et al.
2004; Payne 2001) suggests that protesters’
race poses a specific threat to police on the
scene. At a more general level, we believe
the literature on systemic racism suggests
that the race of protesters engaged in claims-
making against the state likely poses a threat
to state authorities, who may, in turn, order
police to behave more aggressively toward
African Americans in order to control the
potential threat to the status quo. Our findings
add nuance to these arguments, however, by
suggesting that police actions were not uni-
form across the entire period.

Second, our results are only sometimes
consistent with arguments made in the Driv-
ing While Black literature, but we maintain
that our examination is more convincing
because we are able to control for subject
demeanor by comparing African American
and white protesters engaged in similar activ-
ities. Our descriptive analysis (see Figure 2)
leads one to suspect that African American
protesters are almost always treated differ-
ently by police. However, our multivariate
statistical analysis shows that, once we control
for what protesters actually do at events in
terms of behavioral threats (i.e., akin to sub-
ject demeanor), a Protesting While Black phe-
nomenon is only found in some years. One
unfortunate limitation in the scholarly work
on the Driving While Black phenomenon is
that it has not been able to tell if African
Americans and whites behave in the same
way, once they are stopped. We do not
know if some of what appears to be an
over-policing of African American motorists
may be due to subject demeanor.

Our findings also align with a recent report
about the current practices of the New York
City Police Department (Baker 2010; Hebert
2010). The report shows that in 2009, New
York City police stopped 490,000 African
Americans and Latinos walking on the street,
compared with only 53,000 whites. Once
stopped, however, the likelihood of being
arrested was basically the same among all of
these groups. These numbers show that, while
African Americans and Latinos in New York
are nine times more likely than whites to be
stopped, once stopped their likelihood of
being arrested is the same as whites (Herbert
2010). While our analysis covers a different
time period and is not limited to New York
City, our central conclusions resonate with
these findings. Specifically, we find that Afri-
can American protesters were more likely
than white protesters to be monitored by
police (police presence, see Table 1); how-
ever, once police were present at events, in
many years they were no more likely to use
additional means of policing against African
American protesters (see Table 2).

Finally, while our findings are important to
scholars of social movements, race relations,
and policing, they are also important to polit-
ical sociologists interested in the quality of
democratic institutions because they call into
question the quality of democracy. That is,
our findings suggest that different racial
groups experienced the right to protest freely
unevenly across the 1960 to 1990 period. As
a result, the concerns expressed by African
American protesters (who in our period of
inquiry may have turned to protest because
they did not have equal access to institutional
political channels) may have gone unad-
dressed. This could have led members of the
African American community to simply stop
protesting (as Figure 1 suggests). In summary,
our findings imply that in many years, white
protesters enjoyed a greater privilege of pro-
test, and thus greater access to democratic
institutions, than did African American citi-
zen/protesters. This is not simply a subject
of concern for theorists of democracy—it is
a subject worthy of social advocacy, litigation,
and political mobilization as it directly under-
mines the functionality of a responsive system
of governance.

Our findings suggest some areas for future
research. For example, subsequent work
should extend our time period both backward
(i.e., before 1960) and forward (i.e., beyond
1990). While our analysis covers a critical
era of American activism, it would be interest-
ing to ascertain any racial differences in polic-
ing in earlier and later periods. We think the
literature on black lynching might shed some
light on the question of how African Ameri-
can activists were policed, because this litera-
ture shows that when African Americans
became more politically active (e.g., during
Reconstruction), lynching rates increased
(Soule 1992). While lynching is obviously dif-
ferent from legal forms of policing of political
activists, the causes of these forms of social
control may be quite similar and may be con-
nected to the dynamics of political competi-
tion. On the question of whether our results
would hold in the post-1990 period, on the
one hand, the literature on systemic racism
would lead us to suspect they would. Accord-
ing to this literature, differential treatment of
subordinate groups in the criminal justice sys-
tem is not an historical artifact (Feagin 2006).
On the other hand, the fact that most of the
differences between the policing of African
American and white protesters disappear after
the 1960s and 1970s leads us to wonder if
these differences still exist. One possibility
is that repression of black political claims-
making has entered into different domains
with the decline of African American pro-
test (see Figure 1). For example, it is possi-
ble that rather than relying on public protest,
which resulted in significant levels of force/
violence and arrest when attempted, African
Americans turned to art and music to make
political claims (Chang 2005). The often
discussed repression of hip-hop culture
(e.g., Chang 2005; Prévos 1998) might be
a manifestation of political repression that
was once found in the arena of protest
African American protesters. For example,
during our period of inquiry, activists (on
the left and the right) were subject to more
than just policing of protest events (Cunning-
ham 2004; Earl 2003). Specifically, the state
routinely channeled protest through various
means (Earl 2003) and practiced many forms
of covert repression through such agencies as
the Covert Intelligence Program (Cunningham
2004). It is beyond the scope of this article to
investigate the differential application of these
less overt forms of policing of activists, but
future research should ascertain if there are
racial differences.

Finally, research might ask if our finding
regarding the reduction of protest policing
directed against African Americans in the
later years is indicative of the success of the
civil rights movement, or, alternatively, indic-
ative of a shift in the nature of black political
threat. Based on the fact that most of the
racial differences in policing of protesters
diminished following the 1960s, we might
conclude that the civil rights movement
was successful at ameliorating these differ-
ences in policing. However, it could be
that the claims articulated by African Amer-
icans fundamentally changed after the 1960s
and, more to the point, became less threaten-
ing to the status quo. If this is the case, then
it might simply be that as African American
protesters’ claims-making became less
threatening (at least relative to the claims-
making of other groups), the police
responded in kind by tempering their strate-
gies of control. An in-depth analysis of the
specific claims-making of African Ameri-
can protesters might shed some light on
this question.

threat hypothesis, minority group threat, social
threat, and power theory (Eitle et al. 2002). See
Bobo (1988) for a review of this general approach
and Holmes and Smith (2008) for a review of the
approach as applied to race and police brutality.

. Related empirical analyses find that increases in

black population size enhance perceptions of higher
crime rates (Chiricos, Hogan, and Gertz 1997;
Quillian and Pager 2001), negative attitudes toward
blacks (Quillian 1995, 1996; Taylor 1998), and
favorable opinions on capital punishment (Baumer,
Messner, and Rosenfeld 2003).

. In line with Smiricich (1983), we acknowledge there

are multiple subcultures in police organizations but
note that (1) this does not likely influence the largely
anti-black historical orientation of the police for
much of the time period under examination, (2)
police culture is largely resistant to change (Johnson
and Cox 2004/2005), and (3) while the organizational
structure of the police affords individual officers
a great deal of autonomy (Wilson 1989), protest
policing is inherently a collective enterprise bringing
to bear the full weight of specific organizational prac-
tices as well as individual police officer’s beliefs.

. The other major tactics coded by the larger project

but not included in our analysis here are petitioning,
tabling, boycotts, legal actions, and press conferen-
ces. If these tactical forms were used at an event in
conjunction with one of the tactics we do consider,
the event is included in our analysis.

leagues (2003), King, Bentele, and Soule (2007),

Dyke, Soule, and Taylor (2004).

. We coded events associated with both sides of each

claim or issue area. For example, we coded both pro-
war and anti-war/peace events. In all, we coded more
than 160 different claims articulated during this period.

. If a block party turned into a demonstration in

which participants articulated a claim, this would
be coded.

. The data cannot speak to changes in protest that

took place outside of the public sphere, such as
changes in movements that developed within corpo-
rations. Furthermore, the dataset does not include
organized labor events (e.g., work stoppages and
strikes) because the dynamics of labor events are
likely different from the rest of the protest sector.
If an organized labor event morphed into a public
protest event, it would be coded as a distinct event.

. Because the data source is the New York Times, the

possibility of a regional bias in the data is worth
noting (Earl et al. 2004). Since we are not making
claims about differences in policing across regions,
this does not affect the article at hand. We do, how-
ever, include a dummy variable coded 1 when an
event took place in New York to control for this
possibility. We also include a dummy variable for
whether an event took place in the South, for rea-
sons described in the body of the text.

. Our coding mechanism, coder manuals, coder train-

ing, and frequent coder meetings are responsible for
such a high level of reliability. First, we began this
project by coding seven years of data with a much
longer and elaborate coding mechanism than that
which was ultimately used for the entire period.
After coding these seven years and computing reli-
ability estimates for each item for approximately 25
coders, we eliminated any item on the coding mech-
anism that did not consistently achieve satisfactory
reliability. We then dramatically scaled back the
coding mechanism and revised our rules to achieve
higher reliability. During all phases of the project,
coders went through an intensive training that
took place over several weeks, and they were
always given extensive documentation and man-
uals, including a large document called “Frequently
Asked Coding Questions.” Next, at all three univer-
sity sites where coding was taking place, teams met
weekly (and sometimes more frequently) to discuss
and resolve any coding ambiguities. Content coders
use a number of different coder reliability statistics
(e.g., Krippendorf’s Alpha, Cohen’s Kappa, Scott’s
Pi, Bennett’s S, Perreault’s Pi, and Pearson Correla-
tion Coefficient), all of which have been reviewed
elsewhere (e.g., Kang et al. 1993). There are two
chief advantages that something like Krippendorf’s
Alpha holds over our Percentage Agreement scores.
First, Krippendorf’s Alpha corrects for chance
agreement; second, ours may be biased in favor of
categorization schemes with few numbers of catego-
Ties. We experimented with several of these statistics
over the course of this project, and we always
received satisfactory scores, even when using more
complex indexes such as Krippendorf’s Alpha or
Cohen’s Kappa. We decided to use the simplest
and most convenient method because, over the
course of the project, we had close to 200 coders,
working across three universities, and we conducted
inter-coder reliability scores at least once a semester.
Do we wish we had always computed several differ-
ent scores? Of course. Alas, we did not.

. In some of the statistical analysis presented here,

there are somewhat fewer cases due to missing
data on one or more variables. The full database
from which we drew these events covers well
over 22,000 events, but this is because it includes
events using tactical forms we exclude here (see
note 5).

Tables Al and A2 in the Appendix present descrip-
tive statistics on all of our independent variables.
Data are drawn directly from the news articles on
the protest events, as described earlier.

The specific categories are as follows: category 1 =
fewer than 10 protesters, category 2 = 10 to 49, cat-
egory 3 = 50 to 99, category 4 = 100 to 999, cate-
gory 5 = 1,000 to 9,999, and category 6 = more
than 10,000 participants.

As a robustness check, we ran the analyses on two
different sets of events: events for which the num-
ber of participants was reported in the news article
and those for which coders estimated the number of
participants. The pattern of results is the same for
both sets and for the results presented here.

Our data do not allow us to compute an exact ratio
of African American to white protesters at a given
event because newspaper accounts rarely provide
such detail. However, we did run our models on
events at which only African Americans were pres-
ent, and on events at which African Americans and
one or more groups protested together. The findings
in both cases are consistent with those presented
here, which examine events at which at least some
of the protesters were African American.

We are not the first to raise this measurement issue.
Recent scholarship has attempted to redress this by
including measures of subordinate group gains in
the electoral system (Parker, Stults, and Rice
2005; Soule and Van Dyke 1999) or by arguing
that the threat posed by a subordinate group is really
a multi-dimensional construct that involves both
race and class (Jacobs and Helms 1999). Other
scholars argue that facets of the governmental sys-
tem (e.g., type of political machine) affect the
degree of perceived threat that a subordinate group
may pose (Brown and Warmer 1992), as does the
partisanship of those in power (Jacobs and Helms
1999) and third-party strength (Olzak 1992; Soule
1992).

For a broader discussion of racial discrimination
and how to measure it, see the National Research
Council (2004).

. For example, it could be that a group of protesters

moves from event to event, which would mean
that protest events (and police response to them)
are not entirely independent. There is no way to
determine this in the data. We thus use this cluster-
ing procedure, recognizing that this does not com-
pletely deal with the possibility that events are not
independent.

. We use multinomial logistic regression at the

request of the editors of ASR. While we recognize
that these policing strategies are not inherently inde-
pendent, for the purposes of model estimation, we
coded them into combinations such that the four
possible combinations (do nothing, make arrests,
use force/violence, or make arrests and use force/
violence) are exhaustive and mutually exclusive.
As a robustness check, we estimated these models
using separate logistic regression models for each
strategy and using bivariate probit (here, modeling
arrests and the use of force as two separate but
potentially related choices). In both cases, the sub-
stantive findings are similar. These results are avail-
able from the authors.

. There is some discussion in the literature about

exactly how many knots should be used. In this
case, we first fit a generalized additive model
(Andersen 2009), which uses generalized cross val-
idation and backfitting to produce the smooth with-
out overfitting the data. These indicate that using
five degrees of freedom (or two interior knots in
the cubic B-spline) would suffice to capture the sys-
tematic features of the relationship. Furthermore,
Keele (2008:60) notes that “fortunately, the spline
fit is usually not overtly sensitive to the number
of knots selected.” Keele (2008:60) also notes
that ‘four knots is a standard starting point.” We
were guided to our selection by existing literature
and by earlier reviewers of the manuscript who
argued that there were various historical changes
in the policing of African Americans in general
that largely shifted in each of the decades within
our investigation.

. In analyses not shown here but available from the

authors, we explored whether other ethnic group
events were more likely to meet with police pres-
ence, force/violence, and arrests. From this analysis,
we find that Latino protest events were more likely
than the reference group (non-ethnic/racial events)
to have police show up, but they were no more
likely than other events to be met with force/
violence or arrests. Asian events were no more
likely than the reference group to be policed in
any of the manners explored here. We also find
no evidence that religious (e.g., Christian, Jewish,
or Muslim) or women’s events were more likely
to be policed.

. With respect to our two control measures, we see

that across the two models in Table 1, events taking
place in New York were less likely to draw police
presence than were events in other states, while
events in the South were more likely to draw police
presence.

. We present graphical evidence of this in the online

supplement.

. In results not presented here, we show that the non-

linear time trend is statistically superior to a linear
time trend. These results are available from the
authors upon request.

. In Models 3 and 4, the omnibus test for African

American presence shows that the addition of the

a statistical improvement. This is evidence in sup-
port of a Protesting While Black phenomenon. Sta-
tistically, it means that across the three equations,
the African American dummy coefficients are
jointly significant.

We do so in tabular form here, but we present the
results graphically in the online supplement.

As a robustness check, we also ran each of the five
models presented in Tables 1 and 2 (first, police
presence and then, given presence, arrests, force/
violence, arrests in conjunction with force/violence,
and doing nothing) choosing each possible year
between 1963 and 1987 as a possible cut point,
before which racial differences existed, after which
they did not. Each time, we saved the BIC score and
then we found the smallest (i.e., the best) BIC score
(Raftery 1995), indicating support for the notion
that the racial dynamics of policing were different
before and after the particular year. One of our con-
clusions from this analysis is that for both arrests
and arrests used in conjunction with force/violence
(conditioned on police presence) the unambiguous
cut point is 1965. For police presence, we uncov-
ered a somewhat later year as the best cut point
(1974), indicating that police were still more likely
to monitor African American protest, even if they
treated African American and white protesters sim-
ilarly once they were there. For other types of polic-
ing, we almost always found a year somewhere in
the 1963 to 1968 period. Like our B-spline proce-
dure with knots, these findings indicate the impor-
tance of the mid-1960s as a turning point in racial
differences in policing (with a somewhat longer
period of disproportionate monitoring of African
American protesters).
