HIS paper supplements current studies
| of metropolitan areas in which empha-

sis has been placed mainly upon the
growth of suburbs, or the metropolitan
“ring.” The “central city” (as defined by
the U. S. Bureau of the Census) is the
object of attention in this study which
investigated changes in growth and in pat-
terns of distribution of total, white, and
nonwhite populations by zonal distance
from the city center during the decade
1940-1950.

Twenty-three cities were selected for
analysis. Fourteen of these were used in a
similar study by Warren S. Thompson for
the decade 1930-1940.” The remaining nine
cities were selected to supplement the four-
teen cities from Thompson’s study so that
there would be good representation of city
size and regional location.’ The twenty-three
cities are not a representative sample of
any universe of cities.

The main sources of data for this study
were the census tract publications of the
U. S. Bureau of the Census for 1940 and
The population growth observed for the
twenty-three cities in the decades between
1900 and 1950 exhibited a general tendency
toward a declining rate. This trend was most
noticeable between 1900 and 1940. Between
1940 and 1950 rates of population growth
were higher than those of the previous
decade in all cities except Atlanta, Nashville,
and Washington; but they were, in general,
lower than the rates of growth of the decades
prior to 1930.

If the population is broken down into
its white and nonwhite components the pat-
terns of population growth for the twenty-
three cities are more clearly discerned. The
white population exhibits a trend toward
declining rates of growth which is similar to,
but more pronounced than that for the total
population. On the other hand, the per-
centage change in nonwhite population be-
tween 1900 and 1950 exhibits no consistent
pattern for all twenty-three cities. These
nonwhite growth rates, although generally
high, varied considerably from city to city
and from decade to decade between 1900
and 1930. During the decade 1930-1940
these rates dropped considerably for all
cities, although they were somewhat higher
than the rates of white population growth
in this period. The decline in rates between
1930 and 1940 was not carried over, how-
ever, to the next decade. Between 1940 and
1950 rates of growth of nonwhite popula-
tion increased substantially in all cities ex-
cept certain of those in the South. The
variation in rates of growth over the fifty
year period makes it difficult to designate
any trend for nonwhite population growth
in the twenty-three cities, except to point
out that it has tended toward relatively high
rates of increase.

nonwhite population for the twenty-three

the twenty-three cities a pattern was ex-
hibited of rates of growth in the inner-most
zones higher than those of the intermediate
or ‘middle’ zones, but generally smaller than
those of the outer zones. This growth at the
center was not confined to one or two census
tracts, but was fairly extensive, with 50
per cent or more of the census tracts within
the inner zones of each city showing popula-
tion increase. In five of the nine cities
(Buffalo, Baltimore, Cincinnati, Cleveland,
and St. Louis) this increase was due entirely
to growth of nonwhite population; while in
the other four cities (Boston, Philadelphia,
Chicago, and Columbus) there was growth
of both white and nonwhite population in
the inner zones. In the remaining fourteen
cities of the study the more consistent pat-
tern of decentralization prevailed during the
decade, that is, population decline at the
center with increasing rates of population
growth as distance from the center of the
city increased.

Analysis of population growth by zonal
distance from the center of the city using
per cent distributions for 1940 and 1950
further supported the hypothesis of a con-
tinuing trend toward decentralization. Be-
tween 1940 and 1950 the proportion of pop-
ulation in the inner zones of these cities
decreased and in the peripheral or outer
zones increased.

Percentage change of white population by
zonal distance from the city center between
1940 and 1950 clearly indicated a pattern of
decentralization. In seventeen of the twenty-
three cities white population exhibited vary-
ing amounts of decline in the inner zones and
high rates of growth in the outer or periph-
eral zones. The other six cities (Boston,
Philadelphia, Chicago, Columbus, Atlanta,
and Dayton) exhibited slight increases of
white population at the center. However,
the increases in the peripheral zones were
so much higher that decentralization oc-
curred despite the increases at the center.

Change in the percentage distribution of
white population by zone between 1940 and
1950 showed an almost consistent pattern in
all twenty-three cities, that of decreasing
proportions of white population in zones
nearest the center of the city and propor-
tionate increases in the outer zones. The
pattern of change in percentage distribution
of nonwhite population by zone between
1940 and 1950 was much less consistent for
most of the cities. In general, however, the
data seemed to indicate that there tended
to be decreasing proportions of nonwhites in
the inner-most zones of the city, with pro-
portionate increases of a substantial nature
in the middle zones, and increases of a lesser
extent in some of the peripheral zones. In
other words, a pattern of decentralization
seemed to be present for nonwhite popula-
tion also.

A more economical means of summarizing
decentralization trends in these cities is
represented by two indexes, the “index of
zonal redistribution” and the “index of cen-
tralization.” ° The former compares the zonal
distribution of one population at two points
in time, whereas the latter compares the
zonal distributions of two populations groups
at one point in time. Both are computed in
the same way. Table 2 presents illustrative
data and the computation of an index of
zonal redistribution for a single city.

per cent of the 1940 population and along
the X axis is the cumulative per cent of the

dexes indicate what is to be expected,
namely, that nonwhite population is more
centralized than white population. The third
column of Table 4, showing the difference
between the 1940 and 1950 indexes of each
city, indicates the extent and direction of
change in centralization of nonwhites with
respect to whites during the decade. In the
eleven cities where the value of the difference
is negative, nonwhites have become less
centralized with respect to whites. This indi-
cates that nonwhite population is decentraliz-
ing at a rate somewhat higher than that of
the white population, such that the distribu-
tion of the nonwhite population in the city
is tending, however slightly, to approach the
distribution of the white population. In the
other twelve cities the difference in the in-
dexes is positive, that is, nonwhites have
tended to become more centralized with
respect to white population. This occurs be-
cause white population is decentralizing at
a rate higher than that of the nonwhite
population, with the result that the zonal
distributions of the two populations are
tending to diverge.

The relationships of the rate of growth
and the zonal redistribution of nonwhite
population with the change in degree of
centralization of nonwhites with respect to
whites between 1940 and 1950 for the
twenty-three cities were examined. An in-
verse association was shown to exist be-
tween rates of growth of nonwhite popula-
tion and the change in the index of
centralization of nonwhites with respect to
whites between 1940 and 1950; that is, the
higher the rate of growth of nonwhite popu-
lation during the decade, the smaller the
index of centralization in 1950. The degree
of this association was moderately high with
a correlation of —.60.

The association between the index of
zonal redistribution of 1950 nonwhite popu-
lation with respect to 1940 nonwhite popula-
tion and the change in the index of centrali-
zation of nonwhites with respect to whites
between 1940 and 1950 was shown to be
direct and relatively high, with a correlation
of .84. It appeared then, that the less
centralized 1950 nonwhite population was
with respect to 1940 nonwhite population,
the smaller was the index of centralization
in 1950.
Similarly, using the rate of growth of
white population and the index of zonal re-
distribution of 1950 white population with
respect to 1940 white population, the associ-
ation of each of these with the change in the
index of centralization of nonwhites with
respect to whites between 1940 and 1950 pro-
duced correlations of only —.06 and —.11,
respectively. Evidently, differences in the
amount and direction of change in distribu-
tion of nonwhite population with respect to
white population between 1940 and 1950 in
the twenty-three cities were due in large
measure to the population growth and the
patterns of change in distribution of the non-
white rather than the white population.

The final hypothesis tested was that, in
the twenty-three cities, zones which in-
creased in nonwhite population would ex-
perience decline or only very slight growth
in white population, whereas zones exhibit-
ing increases in white population would have
little or no increase in nonwhite population.
Analysis of the zones of the twenty-three
cities, utilizing the amounts of change in
white and nonwhite population between 1940
and 1950, showed that 46 per cent of them
fell into the category where nonwhite popu-
lation increase was higher than that of the
white population, and that 40 per cent had
increases in white population higher than in
nonwhite population. In the remaining 14
per cent of the zones white and nonwhite
population increases were similar.
URING the past decade many changes

of law and administrative policy have

favored desegregation of ethnic min-
orities. A challenging question for the social
scientist is the determination of the degree
to which policy changes are followed by
changes in actual practice. To meet this
challenge three actions are necessary: (1)
the development of adequate operational
definitions of the term segregation, including
specification of the kind of segregation being
considered, (2) the invention of valid and
sensitive measures of segregation, and (3)
the application of such measurements
through time to reflect changes of practice
coincident with or consequent upon such
changes in policy.

With regard to segregation by residence
the first two steps have been taken. During
the past decade, a number of different seg-
regation indexes have been developed and
applied to American cities.1 It should now

have been proposed see Wendell Bell, “A Proba-
be possible to take the third step and by
application of one or more of these indexes
at different points in time, determine inter-
vening changes of segregation patterns.
