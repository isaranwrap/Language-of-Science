ABSTRACT

The divorce rate in Japan has been declining, owing, in the main, to the following
factors: (1) education, particularly education of women, which has shown rapid
expansion during the present century and which has greatly affected the ideas and
attitudes of the individual woman and thus, in turn, her status; (2) increasing num-
ber of books, magazines, and papers; in 1923 there were more than twenty monthly
publications for women and girls in Japan—publications discussing such subjects as
women’s employment, laws concerning women, female education, the marriage prob-
Jem, women’s suffrage; (3) moving pictures, which play a conspicuous part in intro-
ducing to modern Japan Western customs and thoughts, particularly as they bear
upon the status of womanhood; (4) Christianity, which brought the first schools and
colleges for women and, through the moral teachings and ideals of its missionaries, has
significantly affected the attitudes bearing upon family life and the réle of women—
Christian educated women have been the leaders of the woman’s movement; (5)
expansion of economic and industrial life, which offers opportunity for independence
and status outside of the family. All of these factors, in tending to a new attitude
toward the réle and status of woman, a greater independence for her, and a breaking-
up of the bonds of the old family system, have resulted in a distinct rise in the age of
marriage and a lower divorce rate.

It is an interesting fact that the divorce rate is declining in Japan

under the very conditions of modern life in which it is rising in other
countries, particularly America.
[Chorus]
It is her Eye that shines !?

From the foregoing statements it can be understood that the
young wife’s lot is not a “path of cherry blossoms.” She has to serve
literally two or more masters. It is almost natural that there should
be conflict between a mother-in-law whose ideas are old and a
daughter-in-law who comes with new ideas. Even when “tempera-
ments are congenial and purposes kindly,” to have the conflicting
customs and ideals of the past and present in too-insistent contact
is an unfortunate thing for both the young wife and her mother-in-
law.

Besides her parents-in-law, the wife must win the affection of her
brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law who also live in the same house
(if they are not married). The literal translation of the word “sis-
ter-in-law” in Japanese is a “little mother-in-law,” and she, too,
proves to be a “little terror” in some instances.

Many of the actual causes for divorce by mutual consent are hid-
den behind the formula kafu ni awanai, or “inability to conform to
the usages of the house,” and kafu ni awanai is most likely to mean
“mother-in-law.”

It becomes obvious, then, that a separate abode for married
couples away from the parental house would lessen the troubles
with the “in-laws” and in turn decrease the number of divorces.
This is precisely what is happening in Japan. The change is a grad-
ual one, but the tendency is unmistakable.

II, EDUCATION: FORMAL EDUCATION

It has been said that “the progress of modern Japan is due, more
than anything else, to the success of its educational system.” But,
the function of education in both the introduction and defense of
liberalism cannot be overestimated. When we consider the fact that
in forty years the Japanese public-school system reduced the per-
centage of illiteracy to less than 5 per cent of all the population, the
foregoing statement becomes more significant.

To begin with elementary-school education, the percentage of
enrolment in 1872 (the year the code of education was drawn up)
was less than 30 per cent of the boys and girls of school age; in 1885

about half of the children were enrolled, the percentage being 49.6.
Five years later, in 1900, the percentage increased to 71.0, and in
1909 it was as high as 98.1. The latest available statistics shows the
record of enrolment as 99.23 per cent in 1923.

Table I shows the progress that has been made in education in
the masses.

It is mostly through the medium of education that the major
changes in the status of women have been brought about, and it will
continue to be so in the future. True, education of women, especial-
ly higher education, is far behind that of men. It is a sad fact that
the facilities for higher education for women are so small. A total of
772 high schools for girls with 275,000 students seems small in rela-
tion to the whole female population of the country. But when these
figures are compared, not with the total population, but with the
past conditions, the true significance of these numbers can be re-
alized. Looking from that standpoint, the educational advantages
taken by the Japanese women afford one of the most indicative keys
for those who would understand the Japan of today.

Although as early as 1872 the Department of Education took the
first step to institute the Tokyo Female School, the education of
women was relatively neglected up to the time of the Sino-Japanese
War (1894-95). In 1882 the Department of Education established
the higher female schools and girls’ high schools. By the end of the

the figures are more striking. In 1913 there were 66,888 students in
these schools; ten years later, in 1923, the record shows 284,723
women students.

All these seemingly dry figures are sufficient to show the develop-
ment of education for women. But the story does not end here. It
is quite impossible to realize fully the tremendous growth of the de-
sire for education on the part of the girls in Japan. The demand is
so great and the facilities so poor that not even half of the applicants
were admitted to the girls’ high schools in 1923. Of the total ap-
of which have a wide sale. Some of these deal with the more frivo-
lous and fashionable side of life, but many of them publish well-
written articles by well-known authorities, upon such subjects as
women’s employment, laws concerning women, female education,
the marriage problem, woman’s suffrage, and the like. The April
number of Fujinno-Tomo (“Woman’s Friend’’), 1927, for instance,
gives the ten new problems for women by well-known authorities in
each respective field. These problems are “Women and World-
Peace”; “The Woman Suffrage Problem”; “New Education for
Women”; “The Problem of Free Love”; “Birth Control”; ‘“Pro-
tection of Children”; “Women and International Labor”; “Factory

Iv. EDUCATION: “MOVIES”

As one of the means in introducing Western customs and thoughts
the motion picture plays a conspicuous part in modern Japan. Ac-
cording to the survey made by the Department of Interior Affairs,
the movie is the leading amusement in Japan.*

The movie was introduced to Japan about thirty years ago, and
its popularity has reached a “Jack and the Beanstalk” growth in
Japan. It was in 1902 that the first regular cinema hall, Denki-Kan,
was established in Japan. Today there are more than six hun-
dred “permanent” picture-houses, and thirteen hundred temporary
houses besides. One unique feature of the Japanese picture show
is the film interpreter, explaining foreign films to the spectators.

* Japan Year Book for Social Work (1923), p. 266; ibid. (1922), p. 80.
These professional interpreters, it is said, number about eight hun-
dred at present.‘

During the year ended March, 1922, 10,630,738 feet of films were
inspected by the censors.

These figures show 40-50 per cent increase over the previous
year; 7,100 American films were shown in Japan during 1922. The
Japanese films for the same year numbered 3,200, and the Italian,
German, and French over 200 reels each. There are some half-
dozen magazines that are devoted to the movie fans. The Japan
Advertiser of November 13, 1925, reports the forty foreign film
actors and actresses best liked by the Japanese readers of the Movie
Times, one of the most popular moving-picture magazines in Japan,
with Douglas Fairbanks and Lillian Gish leading the list.

But probably nothing else that takes place in Japan gives so much of an im-
petus to the breaking down of the traditional idea of womanhood as the moving
pictures shown all over the Empire. In every film the heroine is the main part
of the show. She is honored and loved to such an extent that the youth of Japan
cannot help changing their ideas about such things, either for good or for evil.
At any rate, great confusion is being caused in Japan by this new intruder, the
foreigri movie... .. Katsudo—Shashin—moving pictures, are surely making
for more freedom of a certain kind among the young Japanese women.5

It is also the opinion of a certain popular literary woman of Japan
that the influence of the movies upon the girls of Japan is great. The
fact that the young women of modern Japan are getting stronger,
more independent, and more critical toward the other sex may be,
according to her, due to the influence of the movie. Mr. Okino Iwa-
saburo, who quoted the opinion of this literary woman, thinks that
her statement is correct.® For good or evil, then, the movie, in a curi-
ous way, has been helping the young women of Japan to become
stronger, bolder, and more independent, in spirit and attitude, espe-
cially toward men.
To be sure, Christianity was not the only influence; the whole
trend of thought brought about the change, and it may be possible
to overestimate its influence on this particular point. However, the
influence exerted by the Christian ideas and ideals on the tradition-
al conception of Japan in regard to womanhood, marriage, and home
life cannot be denied.

Professor Nitobe says:

Probably most men would admit that there is such a thing as personality, but
they would also assert that it is entirely masculine. Women, they would say,
have none. Their place in our economy has been entirely derivative, never
independent. They have been merely members of the domestic circles, a daugh-
ter, a wife, a mother, a widow. [But] Christianity cuts directly across this
idea, laying stress upon individual responsibility and freedom.”

Neither Confucianism nor Buddhism nor even native Shinto
taught strict monogamy. On the contrary, these religions rather en-
couraged the preservation of the family by concubinage. Dr. Ebina,
president of Doshisha University, says:

There is no religion in Japan that will for a moment champion womanhood
like Christianity.®

The attitude of Christian men to women puts the woman’s question on a
new basis. The wife in a Christian home is granted all the privileges that belong
to women of Christian nations. The same moral standard must be kept by him
that is asked of her. This is a tremendous advance, for while there is but one
legal wife, customs are lax for the man while severe for the woman. From Chris-
tian thought and teachings have gone out the new ideals accepted by many
non-Christian men, showing the wide influence of Christian ethics.®
The last paragraph contains the words of Miss Tsuda, a prominent
educator and the founder of the Women’s English College in Tokyo.

Dr. Faust is right when he says that “without taking into consid-
eration the decided influence of the Christian schools in Japan, it is
quite impossible to account properly for the educational progress
that has been made among the women.””° It was Christianity that
brought the girls’ high schools to Japan as early as 1870; it was also
Christianity that brought the first college for women in Japan. The
popularization of the organ and the piano in Japan, the introduction

of Western domestic science, the study of the English language, and
the promotion of physical education for girls—all these were brought
about through the Christian schools.* With the exception of the
two higher normal schools, all colleges for women are private schools
founded either by missionaries or by the Christian Japanese. Of the
six non-government colleges for girls four are mission schools whose
names are as follows: Kwassui Girls’ School (with college depart-
ment), in Nagasaki; Kobe College; Doshisha (affiliated with the
university), in Kyoto; the Woman’s Union Christian College, in
Tokyo.

The other two colleges—the Japan Women’s University and Miss
Tsuda’s English College—were both founded by Christians, the
former by Mr. Jinzo Naruse and the latter by Miss Ume Tsuda.

Christian educated women are the leaders of the woman’s movement. It was
these women who introduced the petitions into Parliament asking for equal
opportunities for men and women in education and in politics, and the bill for
the abolition of the licensed quarters. They are the real leaders of the suffrage
and all movements for social reform. Also in any general women’s meeting,
such as those held by a town or one of the newspapers, the Christian women
take a prominent part.1?

The practice of concubinage was a very common thing during the
pre-Meiji era. In fact, the law recognized it. It found its justifica-
tion in the importance of having an issue to perpetuate the ancestral
cult. But concubinage was abolished with the promulgation of the
criminal code of 1880. Even after the legal abolition of concubinage
the old custom has been practiced, especially during the early Meiji
era. But with the changing social customs and thoughts and, above
all, with the heavy economic pressure, the practice of concubinage
has been decreasing in recent years.

possibly not found in any other nation.” A large percentage of these
women workers are engaged in the weaving industry.

“The official returns taken in 1919 [the latest available] show
that the number of women as bread earners throughout Japan
proper stood at 3,581,183, or about 13 per cent of the total female
population numbering approximately 27,000,000.’"* Of all the
women workers, 75 per cent, or 2,720,500, were classed as manual
laborers, and the remaining 25 per cent as engaged in other work.
Among the workers, those engaged in agriculture claimed the high-
est number, 1,315,900; the next highest number was 980,000, work-
ing in factories and mines.

As to the marital condition of the women workers in factories and
in mines, the following figures are reported as the result of a survey

* Japan Year Book (1926), p. 239.
The average daily wage of female laborers is very low. In 1925
the average daily wage of a female laborer in the various industries
was less than one yen, while that of a male laborer was one yen and
ninety-five sen. In the case of mine laborers the daily wage for a
female averaged one yen and twenty-two sens against one yen and
seventy-nine sens for a male.

The number of professional women in Japan is estimated as 1,-
100,000, according to the Social Bureau of the Ministry of Home
Affairs. Of these, women physicians, midwives, nurses, and the like
number 98,000; teachers of girls’ high schools and elementary
schools, 78,000; workers in various commercial lines number 607,-
000, including 9,300 saleswomen and typists. There are 4,500

The number of women employed in postal, telephone, and tele-
graph offices is shown in Table VIII.

The Bureau of Social Service of the city of Tokyo made a survey
of the professional women in Tokyo in 1922. This survey covered
goo women, including teachers, typists, clerks, shopwomen, tele-
phone operators, and nurses. The majority of these women, 643, or
71.4 per cent, were between fifteen and twenty-five years of age. As
the age of these women increased their numbers decreased. In re-

gard to marital condition, the highest percentage of married women
was found among teachers. More than half—sg.1 per cent—of
them were married. On the other hand, the percentage among the
telephone operators was only 1.7 per cent. With the exception of
teachers, the number of unmarried women ran between 83.6 and
98.3 per cent.

Among the professional women in the city of Osaka, as many as
91.0 per cent are under the age of twenty-four, while in Nagoya, the
percentage is 76.0, and in Kobe 84.0. Only 4 per cent of professional
women in Osaka are married while in both Kobe and Nagoya the
married number is 16.0 per cent.”

In the city of Tokyo there were 137,373 women workers in 1922,
constituting 13.71 per cent of the total female population in Tokyo.
Of the total number of these workers 16.4 per cent were married.

It seems rather paradoxical to see a decreasing trend in the di-
vorce rate in the country that has been rapidly swinging into the
current of Western industrial civilization. However, viewed from a
different angle, there is a sufficient reason to suggest, if not to be-
lieve, that in Japan the very fact of the industrial revolution and
the ever increasing participation of women in both industry and pro-
fessional fields has been one of the factors in reducing the divorce
rate. But how?

The increasing number of young women drawn from their homes
into the ranks of business and into factory life is, no doubt, respon-
sible to a certain extent for a growing independence on the part of
Japanese women to drift from the old moral ideas that were sup-
ported by the old family system. A Japanese girl today will no more
accept marriage as inevitable and as the only occupation open to
her. She “will only marry when the suitor can offer a good home,
kindness, affection, and security in the tenure of these blessings.’””**

Mrs. Yasuko Miyake, a famous woman writer, observes that the
young Japanese girls, who in olden times used to praise “getting
married as if marriage were almighty,” are not anxious nowadays to
be tied down, and that “it is not because there is nobody to marry,
but because there are few they care to marry.”””

Vit. ADVANCING AGE OF MARRIAGE

As the result of the advancement in education, the increasing
number of women in industrial and professional fields, and of a gen-
eral economic pressure, with a higher standard of living, the mar-
riage age of both men and women has been advancing in Japan.

In the early part of the Meiji era the most typical tie was between
a young man of twenty-four or twenty-five and a girl of fifteen or
sixteen, and girls who greeted their twentieth birthday were re-
garded as “wares left over.” “A spinster of any rank in life over
twenty years of age is rarely met with,” writes Mr. Longford, “and
if a woman attains an age of twenty-five, and is still a spinster, her
existence is regarded as a discredit not only to herself but to her
family, every member of which feels the reproach.” The sentiment
in this respect, to be sure, still prevails to a greater or lesser extent,
but it is not as powerful as it used to be.

Table IX reveals a significant change in the marriage age during
the past years.

It will be noted that during the five-year period of 1899-1903
more men between twenty and twenty-five years had married than

years of age numbered 784 in 1899, 414 in 1903, 253 in 1908, 133
in 1913, and 132 in 1924, showing a decreasing tendency.

It is also interesting to see that the percentage of marriages of the
“old folks” has been increasing considerably, as is indicated by the
figures in the chart.

Thus, the whole trend is in the direction of an advancing mar-
riage, and this upward movement has helped to bring about a de-
crease in the divorce rate.

The divorce problem is a complex one; it involves many social
factors; therefore the causes for either increase or decrease in the
divorce rate are multiple and interwoven, and the whole social situ-
ation should be taken into consideration before making any absolute
conclusion. However, the writer has confidence that the factors
mentioned in this article have sufficient reason to be regarded as
suggestive causes or conditions which have brought about the down-
ward divorce movement in Japan.

We may, however, go so far as to say that not in spite of, but be-
cause of, the industrial revolution, because of liberation of the
masses, because of introduction of individualism, because of grow-
ing independence of women, the divorce rate has decreased in Japan.

It is possible, however, that these same factors may become an
influence to bring about the upward divorce movement in the future.
Time only will tell whether this downward movement will continue.
