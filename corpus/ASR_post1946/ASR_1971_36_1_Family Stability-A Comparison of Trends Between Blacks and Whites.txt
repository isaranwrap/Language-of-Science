From the 1890s to the present, writers have commented upon the instability of Negro family
life. Most have observed that discrimination in the job and housing markets have made it
difficult for black men to support their wives and children. As a result, desertion occurs com-
monly. Family stability has been of interest because of the belief that children who grow up
apart from their parents will be adversely affected. Indeed, some investigations imply that
being raised in a home which did not have both parents is linked to lower rates of achieve-
ment in school, higher rates of delinquency and lower occupational status.

While commentators have discussed family stability, there has been little consensus as to
how this concept should be measured. Moreover, there are only a few demographic indicators
available for operationalizing this concept, particularly if one desires to study long-term
trends or to compare blacks and whites. The major portion of this paper examines Negro and
white trends on a number of indicators related to a specific definition of family stability.

This study concludes that (1) the majority of both blacks and whites are in the statuses
indicative of family stability. Contrary to the images which are sometimes portrayed, most
black families are husband-wife families, and the majority of black children live with both
parents. (2) In every comparison, the proportion of people in the status indicative of family
stability is greater among whites than among blacks. (3) In recent years there have been
changes in family status, although most of them have been small. Some changes suggest a
trend toward greater stability while others indicate a trend in the opposite direction.
nihan argued, was a major reason why blacks
were making only limited gains during the
prosperous 1960s. The Moynihan Report
thus implies that there is a measurable as-
pect of family structure, i-e., stability, whose
level differs for whites and blacks, which has
been changing over time, at least for blacks,
and which has a discernible influence on life
chances. This paper analyzes the four com-
ponents of this argument, with major empha-
sis on the first three.

We seek first to clarify what is meant by
family stability by reviewing some of the
socio-demographic indicators that have been
used to measure the concept. We then pre-
sent time series for whites and blacks so that
the relative levels for the four types of indi-
cators and changes over time can be ob-
served. The final section briefly reviews some
of the evidence relating indicators of stability
to life chances.

For many years sociologists have com-
mented about family stability, but there is
no consensus as to how it is measured or
how trends over time can be assessed. Du-
Bois studied black men in Philadelphia in
the 1890s and found that many of them
could not afford to marry and that some of
those who married sent their wives or chil-
dren to the South because they could not
maintain their own households (DuBois,
1967:164-196). Frazier (1939: Chaps. xv
and xvi) observed blacks who lived in North-
ern cities during the 1920s and 1930s and
believed that desertion and illegitimacy were
common—findings corroborated by the
Drake and Cayton study of Chicago (1962:
Chap. 20). More recently, the black ghettoes
of Washington have been studied by Liebow
(1967) and Hannerz (1969). They report
that many marriages are terminated and that
premarital child-bearing occurs frequently.
Consequently black children are often raised
in households which do not contain both
parents.

These observations suggest that the mari-
tal status of adults, their living arrangements,
and the type of households into which chil-
dren are born and in which they are reared,
all have a bearing on family stability. Thus,
one might derive the following definition of
stability: A stable family system is one in
which adults marry and live with their
spouses, in their own households and in which
children are born into and raised in such a
household.

On several counts, however, such an over-
arching definition of family stability is not
too useful. Data that would enable house-
holds in the United States to be classified as
“stable” or “unstable” according to this com-
posite definition are not available. Even if
such a classification were available, it is pos-
sible that the trends of the separate com-
ponents are not all alike and that some
differ from the trend in the composite mea-
sure. This information would be lost by re-
liance on one composite measure. Lastly,
insofar as stability has some affect on life
chances, it is of theoretical and practical in-
terest to determine which components of
stability are most related to educational and
occupational outcomes and to social and
psychological variables deemed to influence
these outcomes,

For these reasons we concluded that it
would be useful to analyze separately the
various dimensions of stability. Demographic
tabulations were examined to obtain indi-
cators of these dimensions. This search re-
vealed four types of indicators for which
measures were available for two or more
points in time: (1) the current marital status
of adults; (2) the distribution of families by
type and the proportion of men and women,
respectively, who headed families; (3) the
number and proportion of illegitimate births
and the rate at which unmarried women bore
children; (4) the family living arrangements
of young children.

Subsequent sections of this paper sum-
marize trends in each measure of family sta-
bility. Trends among blacks are described
and then contrasted with the trends among
whites. This paper analyzes data for the na-
tional population. It is probable that the
trends in certain localities or among people
with certain social or economic character-
istics are quite different from the national
trends.

single among blacks has increased chiefly
because fewer blacks are marrying at young
ages. In contrast, the proportion never mar-
ried among whites continued to decline in
the 1950s and 1960s (Rele, 1965:219-234).
As a result, the proportion single is now
greater among Negroes than whites, the re-
verse of the pre-World War II situation.
Divorce has become more frequently re-
ported as a current marital status among
blacks but widowhood has decreased. Most
of these changes have occurred since World
War II. Identical trends are apparent among
cohort analysis of these changes see Price,
1969: 228-232.)

Not all currently married persons live with
their spouse. Some may be living apart be-
cause of desertion, others because they an-
ticipate obtaining a divorce or because they
work in different places (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1945:3). Since 1940 tabulations have
been provided showing marital status by
presence of spouse. Table 2 indicates the
proportion of currently married adults who
were living with their spouse.

Among blacks, there was a rise during the
1940s in this proportion. However, since
1947, when this percentage apparently
peaked, there has been a decline in the pro-
portion of currently married blacks who live
with their spouse. In 1969, the percentage
of currently married Negro females who lived
with their spouse was lower than at any
earlier date for which data are available.
Among whites, almost all who were currently
married—about 96%—lived with their

In discussing the breakdown of Negro
family life, Moynihan observed that the
proportion of families headed by women had
been rising. Table 3 shows the distribution
of families by type for 1930 to 1969. Fam-
ilies, as defined by the Census Bureau,” in-
clude two or more people who share the
same household and who are related to each
other by blood, marriage or adoption (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 1963: xi). Families
need not include a married couple, although
the majority—87% in 1969—do (U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 1970a: Table 2).
Families have been categorized into three
types based upon information obtained from
respondents about family composition and
family headship. First, there are families
headed by a man whose wife is present; next,
there are other families headed by a man;
and finally, there are families headed by a
woman. If both a man and his wife were
present within the household, Census Bureau
rules did not permit the designation of wife
as family head.

The majority of both nonwhite and white
families are headed by a man who lives with
his wife. There are, however, substantial
racial differences both in the relative number

was used. Statistics presented in this paper for years
before 1947 refer to families as defined since 1947.
Specifically, they exclude one-person families.
of families of each type and in recent trends.
Among nonwhites, the proportion of families
in the modal category (husband-wife) de-
clined from 80% in 1930 to 69% in 1969,
while there was a corresponding rise in the
proportion of families headed by a woman.
As a result, more than 25% of the nonwhite
families were headed by females in 1969.
Among whites, however, the proportion of
husband-wife families rose from 86% in
1930 to 89% in the late 1960s. The propor-
tion of white families headed by a woman
was about 10% at each date.

If no additional information were available
about families, we might conclude that on
this dimension there was a trend away from
family stability among blacks. However, we
can also determine the percentage of men
and women who headed families of different
types. A primary family, according to Census
Bureau terminology, is one in which the
family head is also head of the household.
We can ascertain what proportion of ever-
married men headed husband-wife primary
families—the type of family which corre-
sponds to our definition of a stable family—
for a series of dates between 1930 and 1969.
Ever-married men who did not head such
families either were no longer married at the
time of the enumeration or did not head their
own households. The data shown below have
been standardized for age and adjusted so
that consistent definitions of the family were
used.
67%, a change which may reflect the eco-
nomic constraints of the Depression. During
the following decade there was little change
at the national level in the proportion of
black men who headed husband-wife fam-
ilies. Since 1950, there has been a rise in this
proportion, and by 1969 this percentage was
at least as great as at any date since 1930.

Among white men, there was little fluctua-
tion in the proportion who headed husband-
wife primary families until 1950. Since that
year, the proportion heading families has
gone up among white just as it has among
nonwhites.

These data appear to present a paradox.
An increasing proportion of nonwhite fam-
ilies are headed by women (see Table 3), and
this suggests decreasing family stability. A
growing proportion of nonwhite men are
heading husband-wife primary families, and
this may be indicative of greater familial
stability. The explanation for this finding lies
in trends in family headship by nonwhite
women. Apparently there has been an in-
crease since 1930 in the proportion of women
—be they nonwhite or white—who head
their own families. Since the mid-1950s, the
percentage of nonwhite women who head
their own families has risen sharply. The
rise in family headship has been much more
rapid among nonwhite women than among
nonwhite men and, as a consequence, the
proportion of nonwhite families headed by
women has increased.

It is impossible to put together a lengthy
time series concerning family headship by
women. We can, however, determine much
about recent changes in the family or house-
hold status of adult men and women. Table
4 presents this information for 1950 to 1969.

Among nonwhite women there has been a
decline in the proportion who live outside
regular households or who live as relatives,
other than wives, of family heads. There has
been an increase in the proportion of women
who head their own households whether it
be a household containing no relative, i.e.,
primary individual, or a household contain-
ing relatives, ie., primary family. These
shifts have offset each other and there has
been little change in the proportion of non-
white women who live as wives of primary
family heads. Among white women, there has
similarly been a decline in the proportion of
women who live outside regular households
or as relatives, other than wives, of family
heads. However, there has been an increase
in the proportion of white women who are
wives of primary family heads along with
some increase in the proportion who head
their own households.

Among males of both color groups there
have been rises in the proportion who head
their own households; in particular, the pro-
portion of men heading husband-wife pri-
mary families was greater in 1969 than in
1950.

These trends, discussed in this section, do
not point unambiguously to greater or lesser
stability of black families. They indicate
that during the last thirty years a growing
proportion of adults have been able to head

Illegitimacy data in the United States are
not of high quality. At present only 34 states
ascertain legitimacy status (U.S. National
Center for Health Statistics, 1969:3-7), a
decline from the 45 states which determined
this in 1940 (U.S. Bureau of the Census,
1943:10~-11). On the basis of data from re-
porting states, the National Center for
Health Statistics annually develops national
estimates of legitimate and_ illegitimate
births. Few studies have investigated the ac-
curacy with which legitimacy is reported
(see Clague and Ventura, 1968:72-81 and
Berkov, 1968:473-498), or whether there
are racial or socioeconomic variations in re-
porting. Therefore, interpretations of changes
in illegitimacy must be made cautiously and
with awareness of weaknesses in the data.
The available figures suggest, however, that
illegitimacy has become more common
among both nonwhites and whites. The num-
ber of nonwhite illegitimate births rose from
60,000 in 1940 to 137,000 in 1957 and then
to 189,000 in 1968. Among whites, the in-
crease was from 42,000 in 1940 to 73,000 in
1957 and then more than a doubling to 155,-
000 in 1968. At each date the number of
The rise in the proportion of births re-
corded as illegitimate merits further study,
for it could result from decreases in child-
bearing by married women or a rise in child-
bearing by the unmarried. To investigate
these possibilities, we computed age-specific
legitimate and illegitimate fertility rates for
1940 to 1967. There is a question of how
these rates should be computed. Should ille-
gitimate births be related to single women
or to all women who are not currently mar-
ried in order to compute an illegitimate birth
rate? There is evidence that widowed and
divorced women bear some illegitimate chil-
dren but most illegitimate children are borne
by single women (Vincent, 1961:56; Kiser
et al., 1968:133). We computed illegitimate
birth rates twice, first including only single
women in the denominator, and second using
all women who were not currently married
in the denominator. The latter rates are
shown in this paper. That is, the illegitimate
birth rates were computed by relating ille-
gitimate births to women who were not
currently married, while the legitimate birth
rates related legitimate births to currently
married women (for other sets of illegitimate
birth rates see Clague and Ventura, 1968:
Table 2; Kiser et al., 1968: Table 8.4).

Between 1940 and 1960, the legitimate
birth rates of both whites and nonwhites
rose, but since 1960 these rates have de-
creased. Pre-1960 increases in legitimate fer-
tility were greater among nonwhites than
among whites, but the post-1960 declines
have been of about the same magnitude
among both color groups. These rates are
shown in Table 6.

The fertility rates of unmarried women
have moved in a somewhat different direc-
tion. Among both groups, the 1940 to 1960
span was one in which these birth rates rose.
Illegitimate fertility rates increased much
more rapidly than legitimate birth rates.
Since the mid-1960s, nonwhite and white
illegitimate birth rates have apparently
moved in opposite directions. Among non-
whites, there have been decreases in the rate
of illegitimate childbearing,> but among
whites, these rates have continued their
climb. The rate at which unmarried non-
white women bore children seemingly peaked
during the early 1960s and has declined
slightly since then.

Despite these changes, rises in the propor-
tion of births illegitimate seem particularly
sharp since 1960. This occurrence may be
for many reasons, We used the components-
of-difference-between-two-proportions meth-
odology (Kitagawa, 1964; Grabill e¢ al.,
1958:429-438) to determine demographic
reasons for recent changes in this proportion.
Four components of change were considered:
fluctuations in legitimate birth rates, in ille-
gitimate birth rates, changes in the age dis-
tribution of women 15 to 44, and changes
in the proportion of women who were mar-
ried. We determined what proportion of
births would have been illegitimate in 1967
if three of the four components had remained
at their 1960 level and if one component had
assumed its 1967 value. In this manner we
estimated the independent effects of each
component of change. Results of this analysis
are shown below:

These figures show the contributions of
specific causes to change in the proportion
illegitimate. For instance, they indicate that
if there had been no change from 1960 to
1967 in the age distribution of nonwhite
women, if the proportion married remained
fixed, if the illegitimate birth rates were con-
stant, and if only the legitimate birth rate
had changed, the proportion of nonwhite
children recorded as illegitimate would have
increased 5 percentage points. This reflects
the drop in legitimate fertility rates. If only
the proportion of nonwhite women married
had changed, the proportion of births ille-
gitimate would have increased 1.2 percentage
points,

The figures shown above demonstrate that
even if there had been no change in fertility
rates, the proportion of births illegitimate
would have gone up during the 1960s be-
cause of changes in age distribution and
changes in the proportion of women married.
Between 1960 and 1967, the age composi-
tion shifted so that it became more favorable
to illegitimate fertility, and the proportion
of currently married women, 15 to 44, de-
clined. In addition, among both color groups,
there was a substantial decline in legitimate
fertility rates, and this had the independent
effect of increasing the proportion of ille-
gitimate births. Among nonwhites, changes
in the illegitimate birth rate had the effect
of reducing the proportion of illegitimate
births, but among whites the change in the
illegitimate birth rate tended to raise the
proportion of illegitimate births.

We conclude that since 1960 there has ap-
parently been a rise in the proportion of ille-
gitimate births. This is chiefly due to changes
in legitimate birth rates, the age structure,
and marital status. It is not primarily a con-
sequence of more frequent childbearing by
unmarried women; in fact, illegitimate fer-
tility rates of nonwhites have fallen.
marry, and any of these would prevent her
from bearing an illegitimate child. If we de-
sire to study trends in illegitimate fertility,
we should examine changes in the frequency
of these events. We do not have satisfactory
time series data for these, but the Census
Bureau does provide information from which
we can infer the number of premarital con-
ceptions. In 1959 and 1965 the Current
Population Survey (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1961; 1969a) asked national samples
of ever-married women the birth dates of
each of their children and then later asked
the women when they first married. This
permits us to estimate the number of women
who had a child before, or very shortly
after, their first marriage. Again we note
that we are uncertain of the quality of these
data. Some women may incorrectly report
the birth dates of their offspring, or they
may report the date of their most recent
marriage rather than their first marriage.
(Discussions of the quality of data are con-
tained in the sources cited and in U.S. Bureau
of the Census, 1966b:xi-xv; 1968:xiii—xiv.)

Table 7 presents data pertaining to pre-
marital births and premarital conceptions.
Figures are shown for marriage cohorts—
that is, for groups of women who first mar-
ried in the designated years such as 1940
to 1949. The first row of figures, for each
color group, indicates the proportion of
women whose reported dates of marriage
and birth of first child imply that they bore
a child prior to marriage. For example, from
1960 to 1964, 28% of the nonwhite and 4%
of the white women who first married had
a child before marriage. As the illegitimate
birth rates of Table 6 suggest, the proportion
of women bearing a child premaritally is
greater among nonwhites than among whites.
Changes over time indicate there was a rise
between the 1940s and 1950s in the propor-
tion of nonwhite women who had a child
prior to marriage but there was no further
increase in the 1960s. Among whites there
apparently has been an increase in the pro-
portion of women who bear a child before
marriage.

The second rows of the panels in Table
7 show the proportion of women who re-
ported their first child was born within seven
months of the date of their first marriage.
Some of this childbearing occurred before
marriage and some after, but for women
who married before 1940 we cannot dis-
tinguish when these first births occurred.
Figures in these rows point to a trend
toward more childbearing either before or
shortly after marriage. Among nonwhites,
the proportion having a child within seven
months of marriage rose from 10% among
women who first married in 1900 to 1909,
to 48% among those married in the 1960s.
These figures imply that a growing propor-
tion of women—both nonwhite and white—
became premaritally pregnant.

We must be careful not to attribute these
trends to a single cause. The frequency of
premarital pregnancy is a function of the
incidence of premarital sex, the age groups
involved, the use of birth control or abor-
tion and health conditions (such as the
prevalence of venereal diseases). Changes in
any or all of these factors may account for
the observed trends (Grabill, e¢ al., 1958:
217; Kiser et al., 1968:145; Farley, 1970:
206-245).

The last row of figures in each color
group in Table 7 shows the proportion of
women who had a child within twelve months
of their first marriage. These demonstrate
Statistics from the recent Current Popula-
tion Survey were used with vital registra-
tion data to estimate what proportion of
women who became premaritally pregnant,
in a given period, married shortly after they
became pregnant. The vital statistics system
indicates the number of illegitimate births
occurring in each period. A recent study
estimated that 90% of the illegitimate births
were borne by single women (Kiser e¢ al.,
1968:133). Thus we estimated that 90% of
the illegitimate births of each period were
premaritally conceived. The Current Popula-
tion Survey of March, 1965 showed the num-
ber of women who first married and then
bore a child within seven months of mar-
riage. This gave us an estimate of the num-
ber of births which were premaritally con-
ceived but borne to married women. Using
these data, we estimated the proportion of
premarital pregnancies which led to marriage
within seven months. These are rough in-
dicators of trends. We could not ascertain
These figures demonstrate one important
reason why nonwhite illegitimacy rates ex-
ceed those of whites: premarital pregnancies
are less likely to lead to marriage among
nonwhites. In 1960-64, apparently fewer
than one in five nonwhite women who be-
came premaritally pregnant married within
seven months but three in five white women
married. This implies that racial differences
in premarital conception rates are smaller
than racial differences in illegitimate birth
rates.

These figures also suggest why the pro-
portion of illegitimate births increased more
rapidly among nonwhites than among whites
during the 1950s. The likelihood that a
premarital conception would lead to mar-
riage decreased among nonwhites but rose
among whites between the 1940s and the
following decade. Since the 1950s, however,
there appears to be little change in the pro-
portion of women who marry shortly after
they became pregnant.
Whether children live with both of their
parents may depend upon their own legiti-
macy status as well as the stability of their
parents’ marriage and family. This indicator
is of interest since growing up with both
parents may influence the child’s chances
for educational attainment and occupational
achievement.

Demographic data of two types describe
change in the proportion of children who live
with one or both parents. First, figures are
available from the Census of 1910 and from
censuses since 1940 showing the proportion
of children under five years of age who lived
in households with their mothers. Trends in
these proportions are shown below:
households with both parents. Table 8 gives
data for two years, 1960 and 1968.

We observe from this table that the pro-
portion of children who lived with both par-
ents was greater among children 0 to 5 than
among children 14 to 17. As children grew
older, their likelihood of living with both
parents decreased.

There are substantial racial differences in
the living arrangements of children. In
1968, 60% of the nonwhite children lived
with both parents but among whites, 90%
of the children lived with both parents.
The proportion of youngsters who lived with
only their mother was about four times as
large among nonwhites as among whites.
In that year, 10% of the nonwhite children
and 2% of the white children lived in house-
holds with neither parent.

Changes in the living arrangements of
young nonwhite children do not point un-
ambiguously to a trend toward or away
from family stability. On the one hand, fewer

First, among blacks and whites the majority
of both adults and children are in the statuses
indicative of family stability. Most adults
are currently married and most of them live
with their spouses. Most families are hus-
band-wife families. The majority of children
are legitimate and live with both parents.
The focus upon family disruption in the
black community sometimes suggests that
the majority of black families are broken.
The tables in this paper refute such notions.

Second, there are racial differences in each
of the indicators and, in every case, a higher
proportion of whites than Negroes are in
the status indicative of family stability.

Third, it is impossible to draw unequivocal
conclusions about overall trends in family
stability among either race. We can, however,
describe changes in particular dimensions of
family stability. Among whites, the propor-
tion of adults who were married and lived
with a spouse has gradually increased but
among Negroes this has not happened. The
proportion of men of both races who headed
their own families has gone up, but only
among blacks has there been a pronounced
rise in the proportion of women who head
families. Among both races the percentage
of births recorded as illegitimate has risen,
but only among blacks has there been a de-
cline in the proportion of children who live
with both parents.
major focus of this paper has been to as-
semble and examine data bearing on the first
point. In this section we review, much less
exhaustively, a number of points bearing
on the second issue.

Analysis of the relation between family
stability and life chances must be examined
separately for children and adults since both
may be residing in other than stable families.
This distinction also introduces the possi-
bility of studying whether the family sta-
bility status of a child affects his stability
as an adult. Attention must also be given
to ascertaining the causal or temporal order-
ing of the stability and life chance variables.

In an earlier section we considered adult
marital status and living arrangements as
indicators of family stability. At this point,
we may ask if there is any association be-
tween marital status and life chances, keep-
ing in mind that the temporal order of the
relevant variables is difficult to establish
from available data. For many men school-
ing is completed before marriage, but for a
significant number this is not the case, and
for many of these the advent of marriage
may affect the educational level attained.
In the case of occupation, it is even more
clear that this is a factor which can both
affect marital status and, in turn, be affected
by marital status.

In Blau and Duncan’s (1967:337-340)
study it was found that men who were mar-
ried with spouses present had somewhat
higher occupational status than single, di-
vorced or married men with spouses absent.
This was true even after taking into account
family background, education, and the oc-
cupational status of the respondent’s first
job. The differences, however, were modest,
indicating that “the net effect of marital
status is by no means pronounced” (Blau
and Duncan, 1967:340. For further analysis
of these data see Duncan, e¢ al., 1968:251-
255).

The sample used by Blau and Duncan
were married-spouse-present or who were
single tended to have greater educational
attainment than men in other marital stat-
uses. Individuals who were married but did
not live with their wives had the lowest
educational attainment among both races.
There were very small marital status dif-
ferences in occupational prestige, though
men who were married-spouse-present had
the highest levels of prestige as measured
by the Duncan socioeconomic index. Marital
status differences in personal income—not
family income—were more sizable, and men
of both races who were married-spouse-pres-
ent had larger average incomes than men
who were single, married-spouse-absent,
widowed or divorced. (For additional dis-
cussion see Carter and Glick, 1970:169-
221.)

The general impression from these data
is that for both whites and Negroes, cur-
rently married men have higher scores on
these indicators of socioeconomic status than
do men in other marital status. There were,
however, exceptions, and with regard to some
indicators of status single or divorced men
outranked the currently married. Thus the
census data corroborate the conclusions of
Blau and Duncan. They reveal quite clearly
that differences among marital status cate-
gories are much smaller than differences be-
tween races.

Much of the concern about Negro family
instability centers on the effect such an en-
vironment may have upon children. Moyni-
han reviewed a number of studies which in-
dicate lower intelligence score performance
and greater delinquency among black chil-
dren who were not living with both parents
(U.S. Department of Labor, 1965).

Insight into the relation of family stability
to education and occupational status may be
gained from the data utilized by Blau and
Duncan. Negro adult males from intact
homes (defined as living with both parents
most of the time up to the age of 16) had
1.6 more grades of schooling than black males
who grew up in a family headed by a
woman; non-Negro males from intact homes
had 0.9 more grades of schooling (Duncan
and Duncan, 1969:277). A multivariate anal-
ysis which regressed education on number
of siblings, family type, education of family
head, and occupation of family head in-
dicated that an intact family was associated
with from .4 to .8 years of schooling for
various birth cohorts of nonwhites and from
.5 to 1.5 years of schooling for white birth
cohorts (B. Duncan, 1967:366).

Turning to occupation, growing up in an
intact home was associated with an ad-
vantage of 4 to 5 points on Duncan’s socio-
economic index for both Negro and non-
Negro males (Duncan and Duncan, 1969:
277). Males from intact homes appeared to
translate more effectively their educational
attainment into occupational achievement
than males from a family headed by a female
(Duncan and Duncan, 1969:282). For black
males, there was also an advantageous gain
from first occupation to current occupational
level for those from an intact home (Duncan
and Duncan, 1969:282).

An important by-product of the foregoing
research is the finding that there is little
difference in marital status distributions for
adult males according to the stability of their
family of origin. It appears that children
from a broken home are no more likely than
others, as adults, to be in family arrange-
ments characterized in this paper as unstable
(Duncan and Duncan, 1969:275).

This review of the relation of family sta-
bility to such life chance variables as educa-
tional and occupational level is admittedly
sketchy and conclusions must be drawn cau-
tiously. The evidence suggests that family in-
stability is associated with somewhat lower
levels of the life chance variables examined.
At the same time, it appears that in nearly
all cases the differentials are modest; often
the effect of the instability factor is much
less important than other factors examined
in the works cited, and by itself the family
stability variable does not go far in account-
ing for differences between the races. One
implication of this is that programs designed
to strengthen black family structure in the
hope of thereby improving the socioeconomic
status of blacks may be less effective than
alternate strategies. At any rate, the poten-
tial gains from different approaches must be
carefully appraised if scarce resources are
to be used to maximum advantage.
