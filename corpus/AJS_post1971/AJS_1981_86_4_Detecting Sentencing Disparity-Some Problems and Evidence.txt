The past decade has provided us with an extensive and methodologically
sophisticated array of empirical studies assessing the degree to which extra-
legal variables influence decision making in the criminal court (Hogarth
1971; Chiricos, Jackson, and Waldo 1972; Wolfgang and Riedel 1973;
Pope 1975; Bernstein, Kelly, and Doyle 1977; Hagan and O’Donnel 1978;
Myers 1979; La Free 1980). These analyses attempted to compensate for
the generally unsophisticated research conducted in previous decades (see
Hagan 1974).

These studies, however, have failed to provide consistent findings con-
cerning the existence of discrimination in criminal sentencing. Some stud-
ies have offered evidence to suggest that sentencing outcomes are directly
related to the race of the offender and/or victim (Chiricos et al. 1972;
Wolfgang and Riedel 1973; Pope 1975; Hagan 1977; Gibson 1978; Myers
1979; La Free 1980), while others have determined that the effect of race
on sentencing outcomes is indirect (Burke and Turk 1975; Swigert and
Farrell 1977; Lizotte 1978), mediated through such variables as prior
record, offense seriousness, and access to bail. Swigert and Farrell (1977)
argue that class has an independent and direct effect on sentence outcomes.
Chiricos and Waldo (1975) suggest that sentence outcomes are indepen-
dent of the social class of the defendant. Finally, Bernstein et al. (1977)
Combining data sets from different years is a popular practice (Wolfgang,
Kelley, and Nolde 1962; Bensing and Schroeder 1960; Wolfgang and Rie-
del 1973; Chiricos and Waldo 1975; Swigert and Farrell 1977) which re-
sults in large data sets, but it assumes a static conception of criminal pro-
cessing. Aggregating over years suggests that sentencing operates in a so-
cial vacuum, unaffected by the political, economic, and social climate. We
argue that such an assumption is not merely a methodological problem that
may be remedied by simple statistical controls, but a basic conceptual
problem that may affect both one’s findings and one’s general view of the
legal system.

Research should account for changes in public attitudes toward crime,
in judicial legislation, and in the incidence of interstatus crime in order to
construct a more dynamic depiction of sentencing. Our data, for example,
span a period during which sentence lengths were increased by legislative
action. These increases covaried with societal members’ perceptions of in-
creasing amount of crime, greater risk of victimization, and increasing
leniency of the courts. The influence of such changes is obscured when
sentences given during different years are combined to form one data set.
Accordingly, it is necessary to treat year of sentencing as an important
explanatory variable.
With few exceptions (see Bernstein et al. 1977), the majority of disparity
research has not analyzed the processual nature of criminal justice decision
making. Most studies have analyzed just one decision point. Unfortunate-
ly, the selected decision point varies among studies, thereby limiting com-
parability and possibly accounting for the dissimilar findings.

Pope (1975) suggests that disparity might exist at the time of dispo-
sition but not at later decision points, such as the determination of sen-
tence length. In addition, populations in the later stages of the judicial
process may be homogeneous in terms of status. If so, findings of no rela-
tionship between social class and sentence length should not be surprising.

If, as the research indicates, discrimination is concentrated in the earlier
decision-making stages, research which does not account for the processual
nature of decision making or which analyzes populations at just the later
decision points will tend to produce findings of no discrimination.
Assumption: sentence length is a product of status differentials between
the offender and the victim in a manner suggested by the research of John-
son (1941), Garfinkel (1949), and Farrell and Swigert (1978) and the
theoretical arguments of Black (1976).3 Given: 100 white robbery offend-
ers and 100 black robbery offenders sentenced in 1973 and matched on
prior record and total number of charges; intraracial incidence of robbery
in 1973: 93% of black offender robberies and 52% of white offender rob-
beries (National Crime Survey 1973, p. 86); sentence lengths (a) black
offender /white victim, 20 years; (5) white offender /white victim, 16 years;
(c) black offender/black victim, 10 years; (d) white offender /black victim,
5 years.* The average sentence lengths are computed as follows:

AN EMPIRICAL TEST

Our data consist of all males’ sentenced in one southeastern state to active
sentences for armed robbery during 1969 (N = 251), 1973 (N = 441),
and 1977 (N = 502). Such a data set allows us to address three of the five
contextual factors (time, jurisdiction, and type of decision). The absence
of two contextual factors should suppress the detection of disparity, as
noted earlier, so a finding of no disparity should be treated cautiously. We
hypothesize that the detection of racial sentencing disparity at the aggre-
gate level is a relatively recent possibility owing indirectly to changes over
time in public opinion, sentencing legislation, and the incidence of inter-
racial armed robbery.

We include both legal and extralegal variables in a multivariate analy-
sis of sentence length, employing log-linear analysis (Goodman 1978) to
obtain the simplest model of interrelationships which fits the data. The
advantages of log-linear analysis over other methodologies available for
analyzing categorical data lie in its ability to test for higher order relation-
ships and in its ability to reduce the complexity of interpreting results. Its
utility in dealing with sentencing studies has been established by a number
of researchers (Burke and Turk 1975; Hagan and O’Donnel 1978; Cohen
and Kluegel 1978).

The legal variables traditionally found in studies of sentencing are seri-
ousness of offense and seriousness of offender. The underlying rationale
for including these two variables is that the more serious the offense or
offender, the more severe the sentence. We control for seriousness of offense
by limiting our analysis to armed robbery. Our choice of armed robbery
is based on two considerations: (1) the relatively large number of cases of
this crime, and (2) the fact, as noted earlier, that armed robbery is be-
coming less intraracial in character. We include two measures of serious-
ness of offender in our analysis: (1) previous incarcerations, and (2) the
total number of sentences received.2 Our dependent variable, sentence
length, is trichotomized into least severe, moderately severe, and most
severe. The cutoff points were determined by inspecting the frequency dis-
tributions for each year and taking one-half of one standard deviation
above and below the mean as the moderate category.

Typical extralegal variables include class and race. As noted previously,
the usefulness of social class in an analysis of this sort is highly question-
able. Table 1 presents selected descriptive data which illustrate this point.
The population of sentenced armed robbers from this one state is quite
homogeneous in terms of education and occupation, and any attempt to
treat it otherwise would result in drawing interclass conclusions from intra-
class data (see Greenberg 1977). Race, however, does not pose the same
problems for analysis. Thus for this type of research it is clearly the better
indicator of status. Race is dichotomized into nonwhite and white cate-
gories.®

We first conduct the analyses with all years combined in order to be con-
sistent with most other research. Finally, we run the analyses separately
for 1969, 1973, and 1977 to control for the effects of year of sentence.

DISCUSSION

Disparity in sentence length is difficult to detect for both methodological
and conceptual reasons. Evidence has been presented in this paper that
(1) the public’s fear of crime and its negative evaluation of court perfor-
mance have increased, (2) judicial legislation geared to making the offend-
er more accountable has emerged, and (3) robbery is becoming less intra-
racial. Racial disparity which does exist, therefore, should be more pro-
nounced at the aggregate level in later years. The importance of these fac-
tors will be obscured, however, if one analyzes the data in the typical
fashion of combining data sets from different years.

This is clearly the case when our data from 1969, 1973, and 1977 are
combined: we find that only the prior incarcerations variable has an effect
on sentence length. This finding is certainly consistent with the majority
of recent studies, which argue that the effects of status characteristics are
indirect at best, mediated through their association with offender and
offense seriousness (Burke and Turk 1975; Cohen and Kluegel 1978).
However, our analyses show that such a conclusion may be premature.

When the “all years” data set is disaggregated by year of sentence we
obtain quite different results. The absence of a relationship between any
of the independent variables and sentence length in 1969 and 1973 is
clearly interpretable in a classic administration of justice framework—let
the punishment fit the crime and not the criminal. Legalists would point
to the fact that even the offender seriousness variables have no effect as
prima facie evidence of a nondiscriminating criminal justice system. But
the lack of a finding of disparity in 1969 and 1973 should not automati-
cally be construed to imply that disparity did not exist. Disparity may
have been obscured in these two years by (1) an overwhelming number of
nondiscriminatory sentences, which at the aggregate level should offset in-
dividual cases of discrimination, and (2) low levels of interracial armed
robbery, which may not have reached the point where disparity becomes
detectable at the aggregate level of analysis. The findings from 1977 do
suggest that a charge of racial discrimination can be made. For that year
both prior incarceration and race have direct and independent relationships
with sentence length.

As our data indicate, there has been a consistent and substantial increase
in the actual number and proportion of the incarcerated population who
are white, who have not been imprisoned before, and whose present sen-
tence is based on a single offense. The reason for such an increase in prison
admissions for those categories of offenders which have up until now held
a status of being “advantaged” seems to be found in the public demand
for protection and the courts’ “get tough” response. Fear of crime is an
important issue that judges and elected officials cannot escape. Specific
court-watch programs have emerged to keep tabs on the public’s elected
legal representatives. The awarding of summary probation for offenders,
including first-time offenders and persons charged with a single offense, is
met with growing hostility. Judges seem to be responding by giving harsher
treatment to all categories of offenders. If so, it may well be that inequality
in the judicial process has shifted away from the decision to incarcerate
or not to incarcerate to the determination of sentence length. ‘““Harsher
treatment” may mean active sentences for members of groups which have
traditionally received summary probations and longer sentences for mem-
bers of groups which have traditionally received active sentences. Such an
interpretation, we believe, is consistent with the data presented. In any
case, the findings of this study should alert the researcher to some of the
problems inherent in sentencing research that can affect one’s empirical
findings and hence one’s interpretations. If, as we suspect, criminal sen-
tencing is a phenomenon influenced by social, political, and economic fac-
tors (not unlike other phenomena), and crime is becoming less intrastatus,
previously undetectable disparity may become more apparent. As overt
race and class disparity in criminal sentencing becomes more detectable
at the aggregate level, charges of structural discrimination will be more
tenable.
in a futile effort, since studies have yet to show convincingly the existence
of disparity in the criminal justice system. We maintain, however, that in
a society based on equality, such research should be encouraged and its
techniques continually subjected to careful scrutiny. The issue of commit-
ting type I versus type II errors is relevant here. Is it preferable to con-
clude that discrimination may exist when in fact it does not, or is it prefer-
able to conclude that discrimination may not exist when in fact it does?
In the past, research which found no discrimination demanded little, if any,
explanation or reanalysis, while research which found discrimination was
correctly subjected to such scrutiny (Hagan 1974; Hindelang 1969). As
we have tried to show, reanalysis and critical evaluation should also be
demanded of those studies which suggest that no discrimination exists.

We have attempted to demonstrate that, when contextual variation is
considered, racial discrimination is more or less pronounced. Although
many studies have considered some of the issues outlined in this paper,
none has previously addressed the temporal contextual factor. Future re-
search is needed to account for all of the methodological and contextual
factors discussed here. Such research should resolve a great deal of the con-
troversy surrounding the existence of sentencing disparity.
