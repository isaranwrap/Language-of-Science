Labor Foundation a social action questionnaire to 100,000

religious leaders of twenty-two major faiths and denomina-
tions with a letter signed by fourteen religious leaders of the Catholic,
Jewish and Protestant faiths. It should be understood that the pur-
pose of this questionnaire was educational. It was designed to
stimulate the thinking of the ministers on radical types of action,
rather than to obtain scientific data. Consequently the responses left
much to be desired when it comes to showing the total action pattern
of the minister. Nevertheless the returns do have considerable
sociological value.

There were 47 specific questions grouped under eleven general
action patterns:

(1) Social legislation; (2) Civil liberties; (3) Codperation with labor
leaders; (4) Industrial disputes; (5) Right of labor to organize; (6) Aid to
underprivileged groups; (7) Political activity; (8) Rural coéperation; (9)
Jail service; (10) Membership in national organizations for social justice;
(11) Willingness to organize the group or participate in social action; (12)
Concrete examples of individual and group action.

O': January Io, 1935, we sent out through the Religion and

Forty-seven hundred religious leaders replied. The largest per-
centage of returns in order were: Unitarian, Evangelical Synod of
North America, Congregational-Christian, Friends, Presbyterian
U.S.A., Northern Baptist, Jewish, Methodist, Episcopalian, Evan-
gelical Church, United Brethren, Disciples, Lutheran, Methodist
Episcopal South, Presbyterian U. S., Catholic, Reformed in America,
United Presbyterian, Methodist Protestant, Reformed in U.S.,
Methodist Colored, and Southern Baptist.

The distribution of replies came from all over the nation. The
South showed the least response; only 50 out of 22,000 Southern
Baptists replied. Forty-five per cent of the returns were from com-
munities under 5,000 and approximately one-fifth from municipal-
ities over 100,000.
Roughly ninety-seven per cent of the replies came from Protes-
testant leaders. It is my personal belief that a much higher proportion
of liberal rather than conservative leaders replied. In other words,
it seems probable that the majority of Protestant clergymen are
taking less social action than is represented by these replies.

Table I shows the response of the ministers to old-age pensions,
unemployment insurance, the child-labor amendment, and public
ownership of public utilities and basic industries. It can be seen at
once that the ministers are friendly to the child labor amendment;!
Seventy-nine per cent, or 3,710 pledged themselves to work through
the press and the organization of public meetings for this amend-
ment. Roughly 1,200 less, 53.2 per cent favored public ownership
of public utilities and basic industries. However, only 12 per cent had
ever worked for the child-labor amendment in the past and only 7
per cent had ever done anything for public ownership of public
utilities.

Table II shows the extent to which the ministers will support civil
liberties. Approximately one-third of the ministers are willing to
make available a place of meeting for those denied or restricted in
their freedom of speech. Six hundred and twenty-four ministers say
flatly they will not provide such a place, while 728 more are in doubt.
Only 4.4 per cent have ever actually furnished such a place in the
past.

1 In reading these tables it is necessary to add to the “yes” response those in the “I have
done this” and “Have and will again” to obtain the total who are willing to take such action.

hand s0 per cent were willing to join such movements.

Table XI shows that roughly 45 per cent pledged themselves to
organize their church or some other community group for the pur-
pose of taking action in situations where social justice is involved,
and 54 per cent agreed to continue in some of the above lines of
action, even if it meant jeopardizing their position. It must be
remembered that few ministers would be willing to say outright that
they would not persist in an action which they believed right, if it
meant jeopardizing their position. In fact it is rather surprising that
8 per cent were willing to admit they would not.?

In the questionnaires sent to the ministers the following question
was asked: “Please describe in as detailed form as you desire the
most significant thing you or your religious institution have done
during the past year for social justice.”’ A general tabulation of the
answers of 2,000 of the religious leaders to this question is as follows:

It will be seen from the above that one-fifth of all the clergymen
who responded believe that preaching the individual gospel, as they
often put it “of Jesus Christ and him crucified,” is enough. This is
social action to them and other more aggressive forms are extraneous
to the gospel pattern. About a quarter have taken action through
forums, discussions and conferences, while 13 per cent have felt that
in engaging in charity work they have done their part.

A study of the above tabulation will show that the Protestant
minister to some extent tends to veer away from action in propor-
tion as it is against accepted patterns of behavior involving conflict
with the status quo or with property power. Sociologically this is
what would be expected. On the other hand, there is a vigorous
minority which does take radical action in conflict with the estab-
lished customs or the vested interests of our time. For instance one
minister in Greensboro, N.C. cites the following: “The Greensboro
Ministerial Association, on my motion, requested the sheriff of Guil-
ford County to disarm his deputized, mill-paid gunmen during the
general textile strike, September, 1934. We were the only group of
ministers in the state to speak on this issue. This request so pub-
licized the practice of using gunmen that the governor denied im-
plication in the arming of undisciplined men and rebuked the sheriff
for so implicating him.” A minister in Chester, Pa., wrote: “I have
made repeated charges publicly, from pulpit, in Rotary, and Kiwanis
meetings, in the presence of Ford officials, concerning the slavery
in the Chester plant; and concerning the unfair methods of Ford in
‘dumping’ the unemployed into Detroit and refusing to care for
them; and similar atrocities.”
