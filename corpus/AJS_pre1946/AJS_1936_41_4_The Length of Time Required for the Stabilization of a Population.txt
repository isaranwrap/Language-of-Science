ABSTRACT

The length of time that is required for the “abnormal” age composition of a popula-
tion to adjust itself so as to fit its stabilized age structure is a problem of theoretical
and practical significance. The first attempt in this respect was made by R. R. Kuczyn-
ski, who took as his point of departure a hypothetical stationary population. A study
of four populations, rural farm, rural non-farm, urban, and total population of the
state of Iowa as of 1930 shows great variance in age structure and reproduction rates.
Nevertheless, the irregularities of the age factors become adjusted and within slightly
more than two generations the “true rate of natural increase” becomes the constant
rate of growth of the population, as the “abnormal” age factors outgrow themselves
within this time.

It is only of late that the concepts “true rate of natural increase”
and “stabilized population,” introduced by Dublin and Lotka, have
come to be widely appreciated in the literature on population.
Though basically hypothetical, these two concepts, as well as some
others closely connected with them—as the concepts “gross and net
reproduction rates” and “corrected birth- and death-rates’’—are
essential in any concrete quantitative appraisal of real populations.*
For purpose of clarifying the main object of the paper, the two con-
cepts will be defined and briefly evaluated here.

The concept “true rate of natural increase” fulfils, fundamentally,
a twofold part. It serves first, and concretely, as a measure of fer-
tility per se, as against the crude rate of natural increase—a result-
ant of the crude birth- and death-rates, which reflect not only the
fertility of the population but also the peculiarities of its age struc-
ture.? Populations preponderated with young people in the most
prolific age periods will show high birth-rates and low death-rates
and consequently high rates of natural increase even if their fertilities
per se are low. The “true rate” rules out the effects of the age fac-
tors, providing thus a basis for comparison of the fertilities of popula-

than “true rate,” as an antonym to “crude.”

tions diverse in their age structures. It discloses what is hidden be-
yond the age composition and furnishes, in such a way, an immediate
check on the adequacy of the present fertility to expand, maintain,
or retard the population.

Second, it is the rate at which the population will grow—increase,
decrease, or be stationary—in the long run, namely, when the pe-
culiarities of the present age structure will fade out, as they will
eventually. This presupposes that the population grows freely under
the influence of the present fertility without being disturbed either
by emigration or immigration, or by changes in the mortality rates.
Obviously, the concept is purely hypothetical in this respect.

Once “left alone,” it was proved by Sharpe and Lotka,’ the popu-
lation will ultimately conform to an age structure which will make
the computed “‘true rate of increase” constant. The ultimate age
composition is called the stabilized age composition. It is a mutually
determining process. Under the influence of true rate—and the pre-
supposed assumption of no emigration or immigration or changes in
mortality rates—the population reaches a stable age structure which
in its turn makes the “true rate” a stable rate.‘

With these concepts in mind the main object of the paper is
reached, which consists in determining the length of time that is
necessary for a population to reach its stabilized age composition.
The first attempt in this regard was made by R. R. Kuczynskis He
started with a simple hypothetical case of a stationary population.®
He then assumed a sudden drop in the fertility rate of that popula-
tion, which made the age structure of the population “abnormal”
with respect to the new fertility.7?, He found then that slight oscilla-

6 A stationary population is a particular type of a stable population having a “true
rate of increase” which is equal to zero. Manifestly, his point of departure was a stable
population.

7 Note that “abnormal,” and for the same reason “normal,” are relative terms. An
tions in the rate of the growth were noticeable after two cen-
turies.

The base was much broadened in the study here reported. In-
stead of one, four concrete populations were studied,® composed of
the rural farm, rural non-farm, urban, and total population of the
state of Iowa as of 1930. These populations differ greatly in their age
compositions? and reproduction rates. The age structures of the
rural farm and rural non-farm have been exceedingly disturbed by
constant heavy losses in the young age groups, especially in those of
the rural farm population due to a permanent city-ward emigration;
that of the urban population, on the contrary, has been to a great
extent affected by immigration; finally, that of the total population
has been influenced by all these factors working together. The net

age structure which is normal in regard to one fertility rate is abnormal with respect to
the other—a fact that is very often misunderstood. Those mathematically inclined
can easily see this from the following equations worked out by Lotka:

() c(a)=be~"*p(a) ; (2) = f, "eM pla)da 5
reproduction rate of the rural farm group was calculated to be 1,301
(Table I, col. 3), which means an ultimate increase of 30 per cent per
generation for the population,’ or 0.9 per cent per year (when free
from the irregularities of the age factors, namely when stable); that
of the rural non-farm group was found to be 1,010, i-e., an ultimate
rate of increase of 10 per cent per generation, or 0.04 per cent per
year, which is a very negligible rate of increase. The net reproduc-
tion rate of the urban group was computed to be 801, which means
an ultimate decrease of 20 per cent per generation or 0.8 per cent per
year; finally, that of the total population was found as 1,001, mean-

immediately preceding one is 103, or in other words, the total number
increased by 3 per cent during this time. An examination of Table IT
reveals that the link relatives of the different groups become con-
stant in the seventh decade of the century which begins with the year
1930. The link relatives of the total population (col. 1) stays about
that time at 100, namely, no increase at all; the rural farm shows a
link relative of 104.8, which means an increase of 4.8 per cent in five
years identical with the theoretically computed “true” rate of natu-
ral increase (Table I, col. 4). The same is true of the rural non-
farm group that shows a very negligible constant increase of 0.2 per
cent in five years, and of the urban group that shows a decrease of
about 3.8 per cent in five years, again in conformity with the theo-
retically calculated rates.

It means, therefore, that a length of time of about two generations
is required before the “true” rate becomes the constant rate of
growth. No matter what the present age composition is, it could be
asserted that the population will grow (increase, decrease, or be sta-
tionary) according to the “true” rate after about two generations,
counting from the year whose fertility was taken as a point of de-
parture, the assumption of no migration and no changes in the mor-
tality rates remaining intact.

The constancy in the rates of growth indicated evidently that the
irregular age factors have adjusted themselves about that time in
accordance with their corresponding stable age compositions. This
was tested in contrasting the original age structures of the various
groups as in 1930, as in 1960—a generation later—and as in 2000,
with their respective theoretically computed stable age structures.
The corresponding age-distribution curves are plotted on Chart I,
which reflects conspicuously the general waning of the irregularities
of the age factors. As evidenced by the chart, the deviations between
the age-distribution curves of the year 2000 and the stable age-dis-
tribution curves are very negligible, especially in the younger age
periods—corroborating the assertion that an approximate time of
two generations are required for the existing age composition to fit
its respective stable age composition.

The same fact is brought out in Table III, where the age distribu-

33 All the stable age-distribution curves were adopted from the author’s study,
“The Implications of Certain Population Concepts,” Social Forces. No special effort
was made to work out separate curves for the rural farm and urban populations. For the
first, the stable curve of West Virginia was adopted, as its r was calculated to be 0.97,
differing very slightly from the 7 of our rural farm group which was computed as 0.93.
For the second, the curve of Oregon was adopted as its r was computed to be —0.80
as against the 7 of —o.78 of our urban population, again a negligible difference. The
tions from the starting-point, were plotted, hardly any oscillation at

all would be noticed.

As stated above, the existing age factors do not participate in the
shaping of the stable age composition, and these age factors wane

during a period of approximately two generations. Their effects, how-
ever, on the growth of the population up to the stabilization period

 

are of significance. These can be particularly traced

in our case when

the total and rural non-farm populations are compared. Though

differences in the mortality rates were very slight. However, these slight differences
count for the more distinct oscillations between the age distributions of the rural farm
and urban groups and their stable curves, than between those of the total and rural

non-farm groups and their stable curves.
growing under the same fertility and mortality rates—the 7’s are
practically the same for both—the total of the population as a whole
rises to an index of 124 with respect to its 1930 level (Table IV,
col. 7), while that of the rural non-farm group shows an index of 117.
Greater diversities are disclosed when different age periods of these
populations are contrasted. Whereas the under-twenty group of the
total population declines to a 96 level, that of the rural non-farm
group rises to 102; on the other hand, the group above eighty of the
total population rises to an index of 268, while that of the rural non-
farm group goes up only to an index of 123. These and other diver-
sities are due purely to the age factors; their effects, however, have to
be examined in each case separately.
