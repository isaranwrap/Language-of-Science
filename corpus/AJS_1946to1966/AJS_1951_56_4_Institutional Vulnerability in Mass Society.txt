VESTA a
The struggle for power in society poses
the central question: How can we preserve
the integrity of social institutions when they
become targets in political combat? The
current weakness of social and political the-
ory becomes manifest when we attempt to
deal with this problem in scientific terms.

In order to provide guides for research,
the following analysis attempts to bring to
bear upon the problem of institutional vul-
nerability a reformulation of the idea of
mass society.’ It is suggested that a close in-
spection of our institutions from this stand-
point will illuminate relevant sources of
weakness and of strength.

The approach taken here is clinical. We
are necessarily interested in social pathol-
ogy, in appraising the capacity of institu-
tions to meet, within their own terms, the
requirements of self-maintenance. “Self-
maintenance,” of course, refers to the preser-
vation of central values and purposes as well
as to the bare continuity of organizational
existence.

We shall approach a definition of mass
society by considering (x) the role of crea-
tive and culture-sustaining elites; (2) the
quality of participation in mass society and
mass organization; and (3) a catalogue of
diagnostic symptoms of mass behavior. We
proceed on the assumption that the achieve-
THE MASS AND CREATIVE ELITES
Critics of egalitarianism have sometimes
put forward the view that the mass, incom-
petent and vulgar, is unable by definition to
uphold the standards which sustain a cul-
ture or to participate effectively in political
decision-making.’ The mass is, moreover, a
dire threat because what was once a passive
multitude, a neuter element in the body
politic, has now become dynamic. In this
view the consequences of democratization
are seen as the spread of incompetence into
new areas and, indeed, the emergence of a
type of man who may be found in all sectors
of social life—the mass man.

The mass man, runs the anti-egalitarian
complaint, exerts a heavy influence upon all
areas of social life but is unqualified to do so.
Whereas earlier the mass accepted its proper
station, now it arrogates to itself the right to
upset ideals of attainment and behavior es-
tablished by traditional culture-bearing
elites. The result is a cultural vacuum in
which no group is able to give moral direc-
tion to society; there is an absence of stand-
ards to which appeal can be made; and re-
sort to violence becomes characteristic of the
age. In the words of a Nazi playwright:

3See José Ortega y Gasset, The Revolt of the
Masses (New York: Norton, 1932), p. 120: “By
mass. . . is not to be specially understood the work-
ers; it does not indicate a social class, but a kind of
man to be found today in all social classes, who con-
sequently represents our age, in which he is the pre-
dominant, ruling power.”
“When I hear the word ‘culture,’ I reach for
my revolver.” Bolshevik activism replaces
“parliamentary mathematics.” In the non-
totalitarian countries, too, a leveling process
in education, literature, and politics substi-
tutes the standardless appetites of the mass
market for the canons of refinement and so-
ber restraint. The mass rejects tradition and,
in doing so, avoids responsibility for the con-
tinuity of constitutional order and the arts.
Hence the very souls of nations are placed
in tragic jeopardy.

This critique is not limited to anti-egali-
tarian ideologists. Even among those who
favor the general process of democratiza-
tion, and who lack any feelings of contempt
for the non-elite, there is some acceptance of
the notion that the mass is inherently un-
qualified. Thus Mannheim, in tracing the
“fundamental democratization” of society,
saw negative consequences of the wide-
spread intervention of intellectually back-
ward elements into new areas of social life:
regardless of what one may think of a spe-
cific elite, it is, in this view, sociologically
demonstrable that the creation and protec-
tion of elites are essential toa healthy society.
A mass society is one which does not permit
elites to carry out their cultural functions;
hence it results in the sovereignty of the
unqualified. Of course, “sovereignty” here
does not refer to government but to the locus
of decisive cultural influence. The rule of the
masses is not inconsistent with elite control
of the state, for that rule is expressed in the
fact that the governing elite is itself formed
in the image of the mass.

If we examine this conception of the mass
as unfit, we see that judgments as to the in-
herent competence of various strata of so-
ciety are in fact irrelevant. What is really
identified is a social system in which the in-
dispensable functions of creative elites can-
not be performed. It is not the quality of the
individuals which is in point but their roles;
it isnot so much that the mass is unfit in any
literal sense as that the nature of the system
prevents the emergence of an effective social
leadership. In a sense, a mass society is one
in which no one is qualified. This is so be-
cause the relationships involve a radical cul-
tural leveling, not because no superior indi-
viduals exist.

If mass characteristics appear in a univer-
sity, for example, this does not necessarily
mean that the student body or the faculty is
inherently incompetent. The large achieve-
ments in technical fields would be testimony
to the contrary. What is at issue is cultural
competence. Where the mass exists, we find
the following symptoms of it: (a) the faculty
is unable to reach the students as persons
but merely trains them as experts; (b) condi-
tions for the emergence and sustenance of
intellectual elites on the campus are poor;
(c) the faculty adapts itself to the mass char-
acter of the institution; (d) standards of con-
duct and of nontechnical achievement de-
teriorate; and (¢) the meaning of the univer-
sity as a culture-bearing institution is in-
creasingly attenuated. This says nothing
about the inherent competence or incom-
petence of the participants, but it does say
something about the nature and the conse-
quences of a type of institutional participa-
tion. The latter is consistent with the liter-
ary-philosophical critique of the mass so-
ciety as the “sovereignty of the unquali-
fied.”

These remarks emphasize the difficulty of
attempting to say that some given society,
taken as a whole, is a mass society. But if we
understand that what we are asserting is a
relation between abstract characters—the
nature of the mass and the quality of elites—
this problem can be avoided. As in the case
of any universal proposition, the statement,
“Tn mass society the creative and culture-
sustaining elites are debilitated,” merely
tells us what can be expected, in the absence
of counteracting forces, when social disin-
tegration thrusts undifferentiated sectors of
a population into direct contact with the
areas of cultural incubation and develop-
ment. Education, leisure, and politics have
been most obviously affected by this proc-
ess. Among its consequences is that political
and educational agencies must adapt them-
selves to the intervention of the mass by per-
mitting participation on the basis of low
standards of knowledge and conduct.

But this adaptation is costly. Elites find
it difficult to sustain their own standards,
hence ultimately their special identity and
function. This is most clearly evident in the
institutions of higher learning: mass society
threatens to transform them into institu-
tions of specialized training. As higher edu-
cation falls a prey to the mass, research as
well as teaching will be affected. The student
will no longer feel his relation to a commu-
nity of scholarship; he is not concerned
about—indeed, is impatient with—the tra-
ditional values of university life. He does not
look forward to becoming a new kind of
man; he expects to retain his commonness
and to be distinguished from the multitude
only by a certain technical competence. Like
his highly specialized professor, his partici-
pation is segmental; it does not commit him
as a whole man to becoming the bearer and
protector of the society’s aspirations. In the
faculties two new types will become more
prominent: the technician and the dema-
gogue. Only these will maintain and increase
enrolments; more important—the level of
enrolment could indeed be steady—only
these will earn the plaudits of the student
body. The student will become his teacher’s
judge, sometimes even explicitly so. The re-
sult will be a decline in the university’s abil-
ity to affect deeply the life of the student
and concomitantly an increase in the vul-
nerability of both faculty and student to the
stereotyped blandishments of the market
place.s

Similar tendencies threaten all the highly
sensitive institutions which protect existing
standards and are the sources of cultural de-
velopment. Even the church is not immune
to this danger. Impatient of theological sub-
tlety (not merely ignorant and deferential as
in the past), uncertain and inadequate, the
preacher as social worker deserts his distinc-
tive cultural role. He becomes defensive
about propagating religious values; he does
not sustain the image of charitable or other
activities as primarily spiritual missions. He
finds new security in a feeling of oneness
with the common man, but as a result he
may fail as a moral and spiritual leader.
Even where religion flourishes, demagogy
may become the characteristic product of
the times, the leader reflecting the mind and
the fluctuating mood of the mass.

The strength of cultural values depends
upon the ability of key agencies to transmit
them without serious attenuation and dis-
tortion. But this in turn requires that these
institutions be secure, that the elites which
man them be able to maintain their distinc-
tive identities. This becomes increasingly
difficult as powerful solvents—science, tech-
nology, industrialization, urbanization—
warp the self-confidence of the culture-bear-
ers and, at the same time, expose them to
the pressures of an emergent mass.

From a research standpoint, this analysis
suggests that inquiry into institutional vul-
nerability should focus attention upon the
conditions which affect the ability of elites
to maintain those standards and self-images
which invest the institution as a whole with
its cultural meaning.

It should be emphasized that no commit-
ment to established values and institutions
follows from what has been said here. The
problem is strictly clinical: If we wish to
preserve the integrity of certain institu-
tions, these are among the conditions we
must investigate and control. Whether in
any specific case the institution is worth
preserving must be determined on other
grounds.
stitutions and codes are broken down, as
they break free, to reunite again in artificial
ways. In other words, as family, church, and
traditional political ties weaken, a psycho-
logical atomization takes place. This process
is not completed overnight; nor does unem-
ployment as such automatically create a
mass. What is crucial is the change in the
quality of social participation consequent
upon the loss of employment in a society
which values work.

Among the consequences of unemploy-
ment is, it appears, a general decline in social
participation. The individual’s ties to
friends and to recreational and church as-
sociations weaken with prolonged unem-
ployment. Family life suffers and cannot
easily be used as a refuge. At first all this is
because of the unemployed man’s poverty,
especially in cities, where money is so impor-
tant. But ultimately the loss of self-respect
and its accompanying insecurity must chal-
lenge his adherence to the codes and symbols
which have sustained his earlier motiva-
tions. This loss of faith in traditional values,
combined with the breakdown of older pat-
terns of family activity, of meeting friends,
of going to church, casts him loose. But he
finds this new freedom less than desirable.
He may take to drink, sleep more, seek out
day-to-day satisfactions in gambling or sen-
sual pleasure; he may retreat to extreme
apathy; and he may search out new social
and symbolic arrangements as substitutes
for his lost community. He has lost his moor-
ings to the social structure and has become
part of the mass. This process of with-
drawal may take a long time; it is not easy
to lose established modes of behavior. But
its general direction is the creation of a
proletariat, in the strict sense of an alienated
mass.

When the normal inhibitions enforced by

8 The studies of E. Wight Bakke and his associ-
ates support this conclusion, though, of course,
among the American workers observed, only the be-
ginnings of the process could be discerned (see Citi-
zens without Work: A Study of the Effects of Unem-

ployment upon the Workers’ Social Relations and
Practices [New Haven: Yale University Press

1940).
tradition and social structure are loosened—
and this, of course, occurs as a product of far
more general and diverse conditions than
unemployment—the undifferentiated mass
emerges. Thus the mass has been associated
with the idea of a crowd, most explicitly by
Lederer. In the crowd, we find a temporary
lack of differentiation, reinforced by circular
response and high emotion, with concomi-
tant loosening of inhibitions. The amor-
phousness of the mass is similar but is the
result of a general and persistent mode of
life. It does not rest upon psychological rap-
port but upon the atrophy of meaningful hu-
man relations, the disintegration of tradi-
tional institutional systems, and the rejec-
tion of old loyalties. Moreover, the readiness
for manipulation by symbols, especially
those permitting sado-masochistic releases,
is characteristic of the mass as of the crowd.

The alienated mass man is in society but
not of it. He does not accept responsibility
for the preservation of value systems; hence
he may be easily moved to new adherence.
Here the insights developed by Fromm in
his Escape from Freedom are applicable.®
The emergent mass is not stable. The free-
dom thrust upon it by the decay of social
ties has significant psychological conse-
quences. The need to belong is unfulfilled;
insecurity follows and, with it, anxiety-
laden efforts to find a way back to status and
function and to a sense of relationship with
society.

But these efforts are compulsive: en-
forced by urgent psychological pressures,
they result in distorted, pathological re-
sponses. There arises the phenomenon of the
Ersaizgemeinschaft, the “substitute com-
munity,” in which essentially unsatisfying
types of community integration—most ex-
plicitly revealed in fascism—are leaned upon.
for sustenance. This commitment is, how-
ever, suffused with tension and requires con-
tinuous renewal, resulting ultimately in a
radical dependence of the individual upon
his substitute symbols, a vain effort to
escape anxiety by blotting out his own iden-

York: Farrar & Rinehart, 1941).
tity. This process, as Fromm describes it, is
conducive to submission to totalitarian con-
trol, aggression against the weak, nihilism,
and compulsive conformity. These are the
symptoms of the mass when the disease is
well developed.”

It follows from this analysis that mass
need not denote large numbers, though, of
course, sheer numbers are important, espe-
cially in urban areas. Indeed, it is theoreti-
cally possible to have mass phenomena in
relatively small populations and conversely
to have very large and densely settled popu-
lations (e.g., on the Japanese countryside)
which are not mass in nature. When we refer
to a population as a mass, we are thinking of
its members as undifferentiated, as forming
an unstructured collectivity withdrawn
from the normal, spontaneous commitments
of social life. We are also thinking of the con-
sequences which flow from this situation.
Mass connotes a “glob of humanity,” as
against the intricately related, institution-
ally bound groupings which form a healthy
social organism.”

Prolonged unemployment, it is clear, of-
fers only the most congenial and easily rec-
ognizable conditions for the emergence of a
mass. In fact, wherever culture impinges
upon the individual only superficially, the
emergence of mass phenomena may be an-
ticipated. By “culture,” of course, we mean
not simply the arts or manners but the basic
patterns of motivation and inhibition—the
aspirations and the discipline—which are
transmitted from one generation to another.
When the culture is transmitted only
weakly, as in the cases of certain second-
generation immigrant groups and of primi-
tive peoples under the impact of white cul-
ture, inhibitions are poorly developed and
withdrawal is frequent. In extreme cases we
find criminality, alcoholism, and loss of initi-
ative and self-respect. These phenomena are
well known. It is necessary to recognize,
however, the continuity between these con-
sequences of cultural attenuation and earlier
stages in the same process which may have
different, and less obvious, roots.

It is precisely this cultural attenuation
which results from the attempt to adapt the
character-defining institutions of a society
(e.g., the schools, the churches, the political
order) to the multitude. That this should be
attempted is, of course, not a matter of
choice. Industrialization and urbanization
tend to weaken traditional value systems by
confusing the distinction between means
and ends and depersonalizing the individual;
at the same time they corrode the older so-
cial structure and thrust ever greater num-
bers into direct contact with the centers of
cultural development. As the family, the
neighborhood, the work place, and the local
community lose their near-monopoly over
the life of the individual, new burdens are
placed upon those centralized institutions
which have historically been far removed
from the common man. As a result, the
latter can only poorly perform, in their seg-
mental way, functions which require inti-
mate contact with the total individual; and,
equally important, they become themselves
incompetent to perform their essential crea-
tive tasks.

The general consequence of such condi-
tions is the weakening of social participa-
tion, especially a superficiality in the rela-
tion of individuals to the ethos and social
structure. To be sure, the breakdown of cul-
ture is never complete, and the mass may
emerge even before an advanced stage of
decay has been reached. It would be idle to
look for some definite point at which society
may be called a mass, but the symptoms are
identifiable: widespread alienation, a gen-
eral cultural leveling, the compulsive search
for substitute sources of security, and sus-
ceptibility to propagandistic and organiza-
tional manipulation. More important, these
characteristics are reflected in varying de-
grees in specific institutional arenas: educa-
tion, religion, literature, communication,
politics, and industry. Even if mass phe-
nomena are only partially characteristic of
society as a whole, they may be strikingly so
of specific sectors (e.g., among the youth or
in some great industry). Especially in con-
sidering relative vulnerabilities within a so-
ciety, it is important to conceive of mass
phenomena in terms of a set of relevant
predicates which may be useful in illuminat-
ing a particular group without being neces-
sarily characteristic of society as a whole.

It is evident, from the discussion above,
that there is more in the mass character of
an organization than sheer numbers. We
may say that a mass organization is one in
which participation is segmental, mobiliza-
tion is high, and the membership is rela-
tively unstructured save through the formal
devices of managerial control and through
unmediated emotional attachments to a cen-
tralized elite.

Segmental participation —In its most ob-
vious sense, segmental participation refers
to the partial commitment which a man
may give to organizations in which he has a
limited interest and which do not affect him
deeply. In extreme but not unusual cases,
membership is of the “paper” variety, and
the members themselves are easily manipu-
lated by a small core of leaders and their
supporting cliques. The mobilizability of the
membership is usually low, however; and, in
order to create a mass organization, the
leaders must attempt to activate the ranks.
Thus, to take an extreme case, it makes little
sense sociologically to speak of a large “book
club” as a mass organization. And those
trade-unions whose members’ relations to
the organization are limited to the checked-
off payment of dues are not mass organiza-
tions.
A more significant meaning of segmental
participation invites attention not to the ex-
tent of participation but to its quality. Par-
ticipation is segmental when individuals in-
teract not as whole personalities but in
terms of the roles they play in the situation
at hand. This is characteristic of urban life
and of formal organizations where only the
functional relevance of participants is
prized. The personalities of individuals are
leveled; men deal with each other as ab-
stractions rather than as whole persons.

The underlying distinction is sufficiently
familiar: it is that between primary and sec-
ondary groups. Participation which pro-
vides needed emotional satisfactions—what
Paul Kecskemeti calls “core” participation
—is possible only in or through primary
groups. We may have core participation in
the person-to-person group, and also in the
secondary group, but in the latter only by
mediation through primary person-to-per-
son groups. Without the interposition of
person-to-person interaction, participation
in the secondary group can only be segmen-
tal. Fully evolved mass organizations forbid
such primary-group ties, because these pre-
vent free manipulation of the members; loy-
alties to subleaders can only be conditional,
and only loyalty to the top leader is uncon-
ditional. But the latter, while involving pri-
mary symbols, is not a person-to-person re-
lation.”

Segmental relations in a mass organiza-
tion may be contrasted with the situation in
large nonmass organizations, such as a
church. To the extent that a church bases
itself upon primary-group relations at the
grass roots and builds upon the incorpora-
tion of whole families into its communion, it
may become very large without being a mass
organization. It is precisely this foundation,
however, which the modern totalitarian
party, with similar organizations, does not
permit. It does not build upon, but on the
13 Correlatively, Max Weber noted: “Bureau-
cratic organization has usually come into power on
the basis of a leveling of economic and social differ-
ences.... Bureaucracy inevitably accompanies
modern mass democracy in contrast to the democratic
self-government of small homogeneous units. ...
This not only applies to the structure of the state.
For it is not accidental that in their own organiza-
tions, the democratic mass parties have completely
broken with traditional notable rule based upon per-
sonal relationships and personal esteem. . . . Demo-
cratic mass parties are bureaucratically organized
under the leadership of party officials, professional
party and trade union secretaries, etc. . . . Of course
one must always remember that the term ‘democ-
ratization’ can be misleading. The demos itself, in
the sense of an inarticulate mass, never ‘governs’
larger associations; rather it is governed, and its ex-
istence only changes the way in which the executive
leaders are selected and the measure of influence
which the demos, or better, which social circles from
its midst are able to exert upon the content and the
direction of administrative activities by supplement-
ing what is called ‘public opinion.’ ‘Democratiza-
tion,’ in the sense here intended, does not necessarily
mean an increasingly active share of the governed in
the authority of the social structure. This may be the
result of democratization, but is not necessarily the
case. ... The most decisive thing here—and indeed
it is rather exclusively so—is the leveling of the gov-
erned in opposition to the ruling and bureaucratically
articulated groups, which in its turn may occupy a
quite autocratic position, both in fact and in form”
(From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology, ed. H. H.
Gerth and C. Wright Mills [New York: Oxford Uni-
versity Press, 1946], pp. 224-26).
organizational activity can be readily dis-
cerned.

When the community structure and its
supporting codes are viable, it may be ex-
pected that individuals will adhere only par-
tially, with limited commitment, to those
organizations which are only tangentially
related to the family-friendship core of com-
munity life. Such participants may be ma-
nipulated but not mobilized; they may con-
stitute a source of power for some organiza-
tional leadership, but this power will be only
a fraction of what it might be if the individ-
uals could be withdrawn from their institu-
tional attachments and more fully absorbed
into the organization. It is only with general
alienation that the population—where and
to the extent that it does not retreat into
apathy and isolation—will turn for suste-
nance to what are usually impersonal struc-
tures. When this occurs, our analysis entails
the prediction that participation remains
segmental; but it is combined with a greater
psychological commitment to the organiza-
tion. The result is a group which may be
manipulated and mobilized—hallmarks of
the modern mass organization.

Symbolic and organizational manipula-
tion.—Mass behavior in organizations, as in
society generally, is associated with a de-
cline of the primary group and of traditional
symbols. This situation leads to new types
of control, both symbolic and organization-
al. On the one hand, alienation from older
loyalties creates a need for new social sym-
bols, new sacred objects with which the indi-
vidual can identify himself and to which he
can defer. But these new man-symbol rela-
tionships are unmediated; they contrast
sharply with traditional symbolic controls.
The latter filter through multiple agencies of
social control, and especially primary groups,
where the ideas symbolized can be lived and
acted out. These socially mediated values
and symbols express themselves in the way
personalities are molded, and in the implicit
understanding, the capacity to distinguish
between the genuine and the fraudulent,
which characterizes an effectively trans-
mitted cultural system. The impact of tradi-
tional symbol systems is softened by long
and matter-of-fact adherence; it does not
necessarily interfere with rational judgment
and the accommodation of interests. But
when the older bonds are loosened and the
shadow of values is substituted for sub-
stance, then the individual’s communion
with the social symbols becomes artificial
and forced. He is no longer their legitimate
offspring, and yet his compelling need may
enforce an even more intense (but still seg-
mental) attachment to the husks of social
meaning.

The new unmediated man-symbol rela-
tionships have a manipulative directness.
The individual becomes susceptible to ex-
treme types of behavior, called for in the
name of abstractions which have little to do
with his daily life and which he has had no
opportunity to test and reshape. Alienated
from other objects of deference and devo-
tion, the individual may focus all his defer-
ence strivings on the new symbols; but,
since this is ultimately unsatisfactory, ten-
sion is not alleviated, and ever new expendi-
ture of emotional energy is required. At the
same time the individual’s stake in his new
attachments is very great in the absence of
other sources of satisfaction. All this results
in a measure of need which permits exten-
sive manipulation.

An example of this process may be seen in
alterations in the meaning of patriotism.
Sentiments of this sort in a well-structured
community provide a background of ideo-
logical unity which shapes the character of
specific institutions. Attachments are medi-
ated, not direct. They do not normally in-
volve marked irrationalities (as opposed to
being based upon xonrational, custom-
bound elements) or hasty aggressions
against deviants. And they are consistent
with a common-sense understanding of the
nature of the traditional political order. But
a symptom of the emergence of the mass is
the direct, emotionalized adherence to pa-
triotic stereotypes, associated with a loss of
intuitive understanding and a willingness to
sacrifice the traditional content of the belief
in exchange for emotional release. “Ameri-
canism” as a symbol can be dangerous be-
cause it is sometimes used to arouse mass
responses in ways which affront the very
foundations of our constitutional order; if it
were simply a name for general sentiments
reflected in the core attitudes of participants
in a healthy community, it would not be
dangerous and, indeed, would not be a
slogan at all.

Another consequence of the absence of
bonds in mass groups is organizational. Sym-
bolic identifications are reflected in and sup-
ported by the day-to-day associational be-
havior of individuals and groups. Again it is
normal and healthy for the spontaneously
evolving familial and community relations
to mold such behavior. But where segmen-
talized relationships have destroyed the old,
given pattern and are unable to create a new
one, the resulting vacuum will not be filled
by new symbolic attachments. This vacuum
will be occupied by a secular, power-ori-
ented machine which provides new (though
inherently less satisfying) means of social
participation. That is why the mass party,
in which emotion-invoking symbols are com-
bined with techniques of mobilization, is the
characteristic political vehicle in a mass
society.
1. Mass behavior results in the debilitation
of creative and culture-sustaining elites —At
this point it need only be emphasized that a
statement of this sort is to be used in investi-
gating specific institutions and segments of
society, not necessarily society as a whole.

2. Mass behavior results in superficial ad-
herence to stereotyped values.—Foundation
for this element of the syndrome was laid in
the discussion above of segmental participa-
tion and unmediated symbol attachments.
A few additional remarks here will be in
point.

The cultural attenuation associated with
the mass manifests itself in a peculiar rela-
tion of the individual to major cultural sym-
bols. On the one hand, he is only weakly af-
fected by them; he does not reflect their per-
vasive influence in his habitual conduct. At
the same time, however, he may develop a
compulsive attachment to the symbols as
such—not to their meaning—and to their
institutional embodiments, especially if
these attachments offer leverage for aggres-
sion. Thus it would be characteristic of the
mass man to be only poorly influenced by
the complex meaning of democracy, unable
to make the necessary discriminations, with
little conception of how to fulfil the value in
his daily life; and yet he may be easily sus-
ceptible to manipulation by wielders of this
symbol, will swear allegiance to it, and will
be prepared to use any means (including
those ordinarily interdicted by democratic
principles) against its purported enemies.
Similarly, mass elements in a church may
have little understanding of basic religious
principles and reflect nothing of them in
their own conduct, yet they will characteris-
tically respond with special fervor to the
symbols of the church and be its most ag-
gressive defenders. This ambiguous partici-
pation, both in symbolic and in institutional
behavior, is fundamental to the mass.

Mass behavior is not a matter of a simple
lack of understanding among untutored ele-
ments. Values (and their behavioral cor-
relates) are not transmitted intellectually;
they are the standards of right conduct, of
proper aspiration, which are taken for
granted in a healthy society. Unmediated
transmission, in the sense discussed above,
results in a cultural impoverishment which
has significant psychological consequences.

The political import of this condition is
readily apparent. When values are stereo-
typed, symbol and meaning become di-
vorced. Their content can then be manipu-
lated with impunity; acts taken in the name
of the values may in fact violate their spirit.
The established political order can no longer
be taken for granted. It must be defended
explicitly, hence held open to attack as a
secular, debatable thing. In the course of the
struggle the embattled system becomes
overrigid, identified with specific forces in
the status quo, and thus even more vul-
nerable. At the same time a pervasive need
for new and more satisfactory relationships
is created—which is in turn transformed in-
to disposable energy by demagogic man-
agerial elites.

3. Mass behavior is associated with activist
interpretations of democracy and with increas-
ing reliance upon force to resolve social con-
flict.—Social disintegration entails the
breakdown of normal social restraints, in-
cluding internalized standards of right con-
duct, and the established channels of ac-
tion.4 This frees the mass to engage in di-
rect, unmediated efforts to achieve its goals
and to lay hands upon the most readily ac-
cessible instruments of action. Ordinarily,
even in countries having democratic consti-
tutional systems, the population is so struc-

™4 The hold of traditional techniques of political
participation—balloting rather than pressure tac-
tics—must be broken before the activist tendencies
come to the fore. Bakke (0. cit., pp. 54 ff.) discusses
the continued hold of custom as restraining the
unemployed from engaging in types of political ac-
tion advocated by radicals. Increased mass behavior
would be expected if unemployment were indefi-
nitely prolonged. Bakke also suggests that radical
political action “requires a greater degree of hope
and confidence in the future than many unemployed
can muster.’”’ However, the characteristic activist re-
sponses of mass elements do not center upon utopian
visions but upon direct efforts to gain short-term re-
lease from intolerable situations: the need for imme-
diate solutions to such problems as mass unemploy-
ment, the suffering of war, hunger, etc., and the
ideological need for “some sort of answer.”
tured as to inhibit direct decision. The elec-
torate participates at specified times and in
defined ways; it is not free to create ad hoc
methods of pressure. The citizen, even when
organized in a pressure group supporting,
say, a farm lobby, can vote, write letters,
visit his congressman, withhold funds, and
engage in similar respectable elections.
Other forms of activity are strange to him.
But, when this code has lost its power over
him, he will become available for activist
modes of intervention."

It is the mass-oriented elite, Fascist and
Communist alike, which is the advocate and
engineer of activism. The mobilization of the
mass takes place in the streets on a day-to-
day basis. And it is characteristic of the
Communist-led mass organization that it
will engage in unorthodox pressure tactics,
for example, the “invasion” of a state legis-
lature. The meaning of such tactics—espe-
cially when they are used before any sig-
nificant degree of mass character has
emerged in the target population—is pre-
cisely to break down feelings of deference for
the lawmaking body and to prepare for
extralegal methods of intimidation. Com-
munists attempt to create a mass, as well as
to use it, though of course their long-term
strategy is based on the assumption that
deployable mass energies will be made avail-
able as a result of more general historical
forces." Like other aspects of mass behavior,
activism is thus a result of the withdrawal of
deference to established institutions. Its ex-
treme versions are well known, as when
mass elements, impatient with the niceties of
legal procedure, set up their own tribunals.
These may retain the external forms of ju-
ridical administration while transforming
its spirit. Such extreme measures, however,
often taken in crisis, represent only the con-
clusion of a process which begins with the
surrender to popular pressure of the values
intrusted to a culture-sustaining elite.

4. Mass behavior devalues social institu-
tions and therewith subverts their character-
defining functions—Institutions are de-
fended, often at great cost of life and re-
sources, because they come to reflect so-
ciety’s self-image. They define its aspira-
tions and its moral commitments; they are
the source and receptacle of self-respect, of
unique identity. No enemy is so dangerous
as he who threatens these valued principles
and structures. Like the Tenno in Japan,
they are the haloed, reverenced symbols of
public weal, the last bastions which dare not
be surrendered, without which life itself
seems worthless, cast down to a melancholy
level of hopelessness and despair. This is in
no essential different from an individual’s
attempt to protect the extensions of his own
personality. Books, a house, signs of status,
manner, clothing—any components of a
“‘way of life’—may come to be valued for
themselves because they define for the indi-
vidual his essential nature. These are his;
they have symbolic meaning for him, a
meaning which sustains him against the de-
personalizing pressures of the outside world.

Thus as particular modes of action be-
come infused with value, that is, institution-
alized, they add to their direct functions
that of defining the character of the group.
The institutionalized modes of holding prop-
erty, defining responsibility, transferring
power, raising children, and directing traffic
are developed in order to satisfy specific
needs. But, like habits in the individual,
they have the indirect consequence of com-
mitting the society to an integrated system
of values. Taken together, these valued in-
stitutions reflect the ethos of the culture, its
peculiar way of self-fulfilment.

We may take it as axiomatic that a so-
ciety becomes confused and uncertain, hence
vulnerable to alien doctrine, to the extent
that it loses this consciousness of a unique
and valued identity. This does not mean, as
many too quickly conclude, that a tight
doctrinal unity is a necessary condition for
cultural resilience. No more than fanaticism
in the individual is general subservience to
dogma a sign of strength. Nevertheless, it is
essential that individuals feel that they are
living in a world of valued modes of life, all
ultimately integrated by a sense of kinship.
This does not require that men should all
believe the same thing. It does require that
(1) they should believe something and that
(2) there should be a core of shared assump-
tions as to the ultimate distinction between
good and evil.

In this context, however, we are con-
cerned not with the problem of homogeneity
but with that of devaluation. Splits in the
community, even those leading to civil war,
do not necessarily imply a general weaken-
ing of values; splits polarize values and in-
tensify adherence, sometimes resulting in a
general strengthening of over-all commu-
nity.7 The debilitation which comes from
the secularization of social institutions is of
another sort. The machinery of social life
becomes nothing more than machinery,
shorn of its valued, sacred quality. As cul-
ture decays, attention shifts from ends to
means, from values to things.

The mass is at once a symptom of this
atrophy and a contributor to it. Population
sectors take on a mass quality as they are
alienated from symbolic and institutional
loyalties. But the movement is reciprocal.
The pressure of the mass upon key social
agencies—especially in education and sci-
ence—results in demands for a narrow utili-
tarian justification. The cultural elites are
insecure and do not feel that their special
(but indispensable) prerogatives are justi-
fied. It is not only the general pressure of a
factory system but the capitulation to the
demand for commonness which leads them
to accept the standards which the mass man
insists must be applied to all alike. This
leveling pressure, indifferent to long-run cul-
tural meaning, combines with the demand
for efficiency and service to deny to institu-
tions any intrinsic value. The mass thus
joins with other forces in industrial society
to transform institutions into organizations.
They become technical (and expendable) in-
struments for the achievement of proximate
goals.

The general consequence of this process is
to attenuate and confuse society’s self-
image; to increase the likelihood of severe
shifts in behavior under the pressure of im-
mediate exigency; and to make possible the
capture of key institutions—no longer well
defined in character—by organizational
manipulators.
