lassical theorists in the sociology of

knowledge such as Marx, Durkheim,
Mannheim, and Scheler sought to establish that
the content and validity of ideas are ultimately
tied to the social and economic interests in soci-
ety (Mannheim 1936; Durkheim [1912] 1954;
for reviews, see Coser 1968; Kuklick 1983;
Eisenstadt 1988). Subsequent research has fo-
cused on how sociohistorical conditions influ-
ence the production, validation, and justification
of different types of knowledge. Few scholars
have examined an important corollary: how
knowledge is selected, organized, and transmit-
ted by social forces (see Wuthnow 1987).

This neglect was forcefully stated by British
sociologists of education (Young 1971). Sociol-
ogists, they argued, should treat “the knowledge
(‘transmitted’ in education) as neither absolute,
nor arbitrary, but as ‘available sets of meanings’
which in any context do not merely ‘emerge’ but
are collectively ‘given’” (Young 1971, p. 3).
“How a society selects, classifies, distributes,
transmits and evaluates the educational knowl-
edge it considers to be public, reflects both the
distribution of power and the principles of social
control. From this point of view, differences
within and change in the organization, transmis-
sion and evaluation of educational knowledge
should be a major area of sociological interest”
(Bernstein 1971, p. 47).

National educational institutions — which
presently enroll about one-fifth of the world’s
inhabitants (United Nations Educational Social
and Cultural Organization 1987) — have become
the most important mechanism for organizing
and transmitting knowledge to the young. Al-
though sociologists have shown great interest in
the expansion, improvement, and equalization of
educational opportunity, they have had little to
say about the nature and social basis of the for-
mal knowledge transmitted by these institutions,
especially from a comparative vantage point. The
types of socially approved knowledge taught in
mass and elite educational institutions and the
official endorsement of that knowledge as re-

flected in national school curricula deserve more
attention from sociologists.

We tackle these issues by analyzing, from a
longitudinal and cross-national perspective, the
changing nature of knowledge intended to be
transmitted by schools to the mass population.
We examine official primary school curricula and
their relationship to national differences in polit-
ical, economic, and social structure. We use a
new data set that pulls together information on
national curricular policies around the world since
the 1920s. We first describe the school subjects
that have been required in primary school curric-
ula and how these required subjects vary across
time and country. Such information should fill a
major gap in the literatures on comparative edu-
cation and world mass culture.

Our main goal, however, is to rethink previous
hypotheses about the rise and nature of the mod-
ern curriculum. In previous work, the education-
al curriculum has been viewed either as the
product of the functional requirements of society
(e.g., the economies of advanced, industrialized
countries require more instruction in mathemat-
ics and science) or as a reflection of existing
power relations in society (e.g., an emphasis on
academic subjects such as classical language,
literature, or laboratory science serves the polit-
ical and economic interests of the “dominant
classes” or powerful elites). School curricula,
according to these views, are nationally patterned
collections of socially approved knowledge that,
if compared cross-nationally, should show con-
siderable diversity.

We propose a different view: The content of
school curricula — especially mass curricula —
is closely linked to the rise of standardized mod-
els of society (see Meyer 1980; Thomas, Meyer,
Ramirez, and Boli 1987) and to the increasing
dominance of standardized models of education
as one component of these general models (see
Boli, Ramirez, and Meyer 1985; Ramirez and
Boli 1987). These modern models-of society and
education and their interrelation, are similar
around the world and generate educational sys-
tems and school curricula that are strikingly sim-
ilar. As a result, a new culture or set of cultures is
being promulgated by mass educational institu-
tions. If we are to understand this emergent world
cultural system, the mass educational curriculum
is an important place to start.

Many characteristics of societies or time peri-
ods can affect the content of school curricula, but
their characteristics do not predict the rapid
worldwide expansion of primary education

(Meyer, Ramirez, Rubinson, and Boli-Bennett
1977; Boli et al. 1985; Meyer, Ramirez, and
Soysal 1990). World educational expansion has
outpaced most national indicators of political or
economic development and is rather poorly pre-
dicted by such variables. Thus, the same world-
wide processes that were involved in the spread
of primary education may also have generated
similarity in its content. This theme is useful for
understanding both the character and the stabili-
ty of curricular policies in primary education
during the twentieth century.

BACKGROUND

The formal content of the school curriculum was
a more central sociological concern in earlier
historical periods. Durkheim [1938] (1977), in
his penetrating analysis of French educational
history, highlighted the succession of political
battles over the officially prescribed curriculum
during the nineteenth century (see Lukes 1985,
pp. 379ff.). Waller discussed the social and psy-
chological consequences for teachers and stu-
dents of the parcelling out of human knowledge
into school subjects and “nicely graded” courses
([1932] 1965, pp. 335ff.).

In the early reports of educational leaders, is-
sues of content — the textbooks used, the ques-
tions asked on tests, and classroom pedagogical
practices — were a primary focus (e.g., see Bar-
nard 1854; Klemm 1897; Prince 1897). Later,
academics debated which languages to teach, at
what age to introduce new topics in the natural or
social sciences, and whether to allot instructional
time to physical or aesthetic education.

In recent decades, however, the basic outline
of the curriculum has become surprisingly un-
controversial. Conflicts arise, but they center on
specialized issues (e.g., teaching of evolution,
gender biases in textbook illustrations, bilingual
instruction). These “controversies” bespeak the
taken-for-granted character of the basic structure.

The issue of curricular content has almost dis-
appeared from social theory. Durkheim’s exam-
ination of legitimate school knowledge in France
was replaced by Mannheim’s more abstract as-
sumptions and Parsons’ completely abstract dis-
cussion of the presumed functions of the content
of schooling (Mannheim 1952; Parsons 1959).
Indeed, in the sociology of education, the term
“curriculum” now seems to have two meanings
unrelated to content. First, it means “track,” or
academic program — a structural feature of
schools that is linked to past, present, or future
(Meyer, Ramirez, Rubinson, and Boli-Bennett
1977; Boli et al. 1985; Meyer, Ramirez, and
Soysal 1990). World educational expansion has
outpaced most national indicators of political or
economic development and is rather poorly pre-
dicted by such variables. Thus, the same world-
wide processes that were involved in the spread
of primary education may also have generated
similarity in its content. This theme is useful for
understanding both the character and the stabili-
ty of curricular policies in primary education
during the twentieth century.
HYPOTHESES

There is little comparative historical research on
school curricula. Springer (1977) noted the pau-
city of comparative studies in the area of pedago-
gy and the curriculum (see also Benavot and Ka-
mens 1989). Lacking basic comparative descrip-
tions, there has been a tendency to apply general
theories about the origins and significance of mass
education to questions about the curriculum.

Early theoretical statements on the sources of
educational expansion were functionalist in
character, with ideological variations. The mod-
em differentiated society (or its elites) created
and required primary education to equip the
masses with technical skills and hegemonic cul-
ture and to enhance their integration into society.
Ideological variations revolved around who ben-
efits from the system rather that the origins of
mass education. Recent comparative and histori-
cal research underscores the problematic status
of fundamental propositions in functionalist
thought: comparisons in the U.S., both within
states (Kaestle and Vinovskis 1980) and between
states (Meyer, Tyack, Nagel, and Gordon 1979;
Guest and Tolnay 1985), and cross-national
comparisons, both between particular countries
(Maynes 1985; Ramirez and Boli 1987) and
across a range of countries (Meyer et al. 1977),
cast doubt on the idea that urbanization or indus-
trialization are good predictors of the expansion
of mass education (see Boli et al. 1985 for a
Teview).

Since the modern functionalist literature of-
fers few specific hypotheses on curricular con-
tent, we suggest several taken from the classic
literature:
In reaction to the failures of functionalism and
its variants, a growing body of curriculum re-
search has moved toward descriptive studies of
individual nations that emphasize case-specific
historical explanations (e.g., Young 1971;
Goodson 1987; Goodson and Ball 1984). Much
of this historical work traces the spread of mass
education and curricular content to competition
among different status and political groups (Col-
lins 1979; Archer 1979). The changing content
of curricula, and the definition of what is legiti-
mate knowledge for the schools are issues funda-
mentally affected by the complex matrix of in-
teractions, primarily in the political realm, among
local and national group interests (Whitty and
Young 1976; Goodson 1983; Kleibard 1986;
Labaree 1986). In some arguments, the content
of the curriculum is seen as reflecting the inter-
ests and advantages of dominant status groups
(e.g., professionals, political elites, capitalist so-
cial classes); in others, the content is less impor-
tant than the competitive advantages groups may
gain through particular curricular arrangements
(Collins 1979).

The historicist perspective argues that the in-
teractions of conflicting forces in particular set-
tings — rather than general functional impera-
tives — best explain the nature and development
of school curricula. This view highlights the di-
versity of national school curricula and the inad-
equacy of general explanations in contrast to in-
terpretive ones (Ragin 1987). Considerable het-
erogeneity between nations is predicted: Each
nation-state — or perhaps family of nation-states
descending from a common imperial metropole
or sharing a common religious or cultural tradi-
tion — is seen as having its own curricular tra-
jectory. Moreover, because the political battle
tends to be fought over the inclusion of specific
subjects rather than the emphasis placed on a
subject once it is been officially incorporated,
this perspective predicts that a nation’s curricu-
lar emphasis will be fairly consistent over time.
Two basic hypotheses follow:
Neither historicist approaches nor the variants
of functionalism have come to terms with the
rapid spread of standardized mass education. To
account for this, arguments about the importance
of a wider world polity have developed. Two
related ideas are involved: First, despite societal
variability, world models of society have stan-
dardized around the nation-state principle (Mey-
er 1980; Thomas et al. 1987). If, despite varia-
tion, models of society incorporating standard
goals like national progress and social justice are
widespread, institutional standardization might
follow. Mass education, which is closely linked
to the goals of national development, economic
progress, and the formal integration of individu-
als in the collectivity, would be a likely candi-
date (Fiala and Lanford 1987). Second, even if
models of society vary, but means to achieve
them are uncertain, we might expect less devel-
oped countries to copy institutions such as edu-
cation from more successful nations. This would
be aided by the portrayal of the value of educa-
tion for national development by the world’s
professionals and scientists, by the pressures of
international agencies and relations, and by local
aspirations for successful development (DiMag-
gio and Powell 1983).

We apply these themes to the study of the cur-
riculum: If mass education is a worldwide mod-
el, or one component of a larger standardized
nation-state model, its curricula should also evi-
dence standardization at the world level. The in-
stitutionalized ideologies of society, and the spe-
cific ideologies of education as socializing indi-
viduals for society, should carry institutionally
standardized content. Thus:
Given the paucity of academic research compar-
ing curricula across countries and over time, we
began our search for data with limited expecta-
tions. However, it quickly became clear that data
were available. Many groups, frequently linked
to UNESCO, have attempted to bring together
standard descriptions of national school curricu-
la. In earlier periods, this was done with enthusi-
asm and flair, whether in the published accounts
of foreign educational systems by comparative
educators or in international conferences and ed-
ucational yearbooks. But throughout the twenti-
eth century, education has been seen as an im-
portant national enterprise — one that should be
publicized and compared with other nations. As
a consequence, curricular standards and policies
in sovereign states and dependent territories have
been explicitly formulated and collected ina great
many comparative reports.

Our main sources of curricular information are
international media rather than national case re-
ports. Perhaps surprisingly, comparative accounts
of educational matters have been geared to an
international audience. As was true with enroll-
ment data on primary education (Benavot and
Riddle 1988), curricular discourse has a univer-
salistic and worldwide character rather than a
local and primordial one. Thus our data were
easily organized into general categories — they
were, so to speak, written to be coded. Although
the easy interpretability suggests the importance
of transnational processes in the development of
school curricula, it raises some methodological
and substantive questions.

Curricular information was derived from di-
verse sources, including historical and contem-
porary accounts of national school systems,
comparative histories of educational develop-
ment, international educational compendia, and
encyclopedias. In 1986, we sent queries to over
120 ministries of education requesting informa-
tion on curricular timetables. We received usable
responses from over one-half of the countries.’
From each official curricular timetable, we
coded two items of information: the required
subjects to be taught during the elementary school
cycle (usually a five- to six-year period), and the
number of periods (or hours) to be devoted to
each subject during a typical week. This infor-
mation was transformed into two dependent
variables: one indicating the presence or absence
of basic school subjects in the official curricu-
lum and the second indicating the relative em-
phasis on each subject.

Specific subjects were classified into general
categories according to the following scheme:
Language (national, local, official, and foreign
languages); Mathematics (arithmetic, geometry);
Natural Sciences; Social Sciences (history, ge-
ography, civics, social studies); Religious and
Moral Education (religion, moral education);
Aesthetic Education (art, handicrafts, singing,
dance); Physical Education; Hygiene/Health
Education; Vocational Education/Practical
Subjects (manual training, agriculture, domestic
science, industrial arts, gardening); and Other
(recreation, extracurricular activities, miscella-
neous subjects, recess, and elective subjects).
National language refers to an indigenous lan-
guage, spoken by over 50 percent of the popula-
tion, that is also an official language. Official
language refers to a metropolitan or world lan-
guage that is given national standing but is not
indigenous in origin or use. Local language is
spoken by a minority of the population and not
given official. standing. Foreign languages are
those that are neither official nor indigenous.

Subjects listed in official timetables and allo-
cated instructional time usually fit into one of
these categories. Subjects that did not clearly fit
into one of these categories were coded as “oth-

 

we coded curricular data for 105 countries and had
relatively complete information for about 95 countries.
The main sources for this period are the UNESCO
survey (UNESCO 1958) and Dottrens’s (1962) study
which was prepared under UNESCO auspices using
data published by the International Bureau of Educa-
tion (1958). Supplementary sources were also used:
Europe (Schultze 1968-1970), Central America
(Waggoner and Waggoner 1971), Asia (National In-
stitute for Educational Research 1970; Ministry of
Education, Japan 1964), and Africa (Sasnett and
Sepmeyer 1955; Hawes 1979).

For the interwar period (1920-1944) we have data
on about 65 countries, with relatively complete data
for 45. Data come from the Educational Yearbook
(1924-1944); UNESCO (1958); Kandel (1933); and
individual country reports based on responses to our
survey.

er.” Most nations organize primary education in
a six-year cycle (UNESCO 1987). In countries
where the primary cycle was longer than six years,
we considered the official curriculum for the first
six years only; where the cycle was shorter, we
included information for the first year or two of
the secondary cycle where possible. These cod-
ing decisions had very little impact on our results.
Some national timetables combined topics we
preferred to code separately (e.g., mathematics
and science). In such cases, we coded both sub-
jects as taught, and split the allotted instructional
time equally.

Data Frame and Coverage

The data refer primarily to nations with state-
administered educational systems. However, each
period also includes a small number of self-gov-
erning dependent territories with official school
curricula. (See footnote 5 for differences between
these two types of polities.) Curricular informa-
tion was assigned to one of three historical peri-
ods: the interwar period, 1920-1944; the decolo-
nization period, 1945-1969; and the current pe-
riod, 1970-1986. When we had more than one
timetable for a country during a period, we re-
corded data nearest the target years of 1935, 1960,
and 1985. Data coverage for each period, while
extensive, does not constitute a representative
sample. Data coverage is sparsest for the inter-
war period (1920-1944) and tends to overrepre-
sent countries in Europe and the Americas,
whereas the sample of countries for the 1970-
1986 period is more complete.

Limitations of the Data

~Our curricular measures indicate which subjects
are required in the official curriculum and their
relative emphasis, i.e., the percentage of total
curricular time devoted to each subject. Howev-
er, we have little information on how many school
periods or instructional hours each subject was
supposed to be taught during the annual school
term. Preliminary analyses show a slight tenden-
cy for average annual hours of instruction to be
lower in developing countries, newer educational
systems, and in the distant past (Benavot and
Kamens 1989). Weighting our curricular mea-
sures by variations in annual hours of instruction
would alter the results presented below very little
(Kamens and Benavot forthcoming).
We have no information on the specific con-
tent of the subjects taught. Differences among

countries or over time in such categories as “his-
tory” or “social studies” may or may not repre-
sent real differences in curricula. Similar general
categories may mask national variability in in-
tended content. The lack of detail in our data
makes it difficult to directly address these issues.
However, categories like “social studies” in-
creasingly denote standard sets of expectations,
materials, and topics. Therefore, changes in these
categories seem likely to signify real changes, at
least in intent.

Apart from the intrinsic gap between general
curricular categories and actual curricular con-
tent, certain organizational processes may widen
this gap (Meyer and Rowan 1977). This is espe-
cially true of educational systems in developing
countries and in less centralized educational
systems (Stevenson and Baker forthcoming).
Policy and practice respond to different resource
constraints. For example, great curricular visions
may not be attainable by teachers and students
with few educational resources; policymakers
may wish to impress national and international
audiences more than teachers and local adminis-
trators do; or local educators may have to adapt
to local requirements), and so on. Such processes
might generate official curricula in greater con-
formity to world models than local practice is,
and produce some distortions in our results.”

tional officials seek to comply with international edu-
cational models, local school teachers and principals

local constituencies and constraints. Given the growth
of national and international networks of teacher-
training institutes and professional associations, it is
hard to imagine that teachers and school administra-
tors in developing countries follow distinctive curric-
ular conventions. It is also difficult for local interests
to develop distinct curricular themes. It is much more
likely that they drew from similar curricular content
frames, though in a less effective manner, as their
national bureaucratic elites. In any case, it is interest-
ing to see whether the official statements of national
educational leaders reflect world standards of educa-
tional policy.

languages is more common in the later periods, a
finding that turns out to reflect the development
of primary educational systems in former colo-
nies (Cha forthcoming). And within the general
social science category, there has been a strong
trend toward instruction in a general social studies
subject and away from instruction allocated to
history, geography, and civics. This trend may
reflect the recent hegemony of liberal or Ameri-
can educational doctrines (Wong forthcoming).
The most important finding in Table 1 is the
rise to universality of a set of core subjects across
the diverse countries of the world. This result
provides some support for ideas that educational
curricula reflect standardizing world processes.
And it runs against the predictions of more diver-
sity by functional or historicist arguments.
Table 2 presents the average percentage of in-
structional time allocated to each subject during
the primary school cycle, along with the stan-
dard deviation around the average. Overall, there
is a good deal of consistency over time in the
allocation of instructional time to the subjects.
For the universally required subjects, standard
deviations are relatively small and tend to de-
cline over time, indicating more standardization
in the time devoted to the subjects. The other
subjects — religious education, health education,
and vocational education, as well as subcategories
of the core subjects —show more variation (dis-
tributions, in addition, tend to be more skewed).

Language instruction — reading, writing, and
grammar — is the dominant activity in primary
education. In each time period, about one-third
of total curricular time is devoted to language
education. Variation is relatively small, and tends
to decline. Almost all language instruction is in
national or official languages (Cha forthcoming);
very little is in local or tribal languages. There
has been a slight increase in the amount of in-
struction in foreign languages or in official lan-
guages that are exogenous in origin, resulting
from the addition of more developing countries
to the data set (and to the world of primary edu-
cation). These patterns support functionalist or
worldly polity theories, which emphasize the
primacy of the nation-state, and run against his-
toricist perspectives. The unimportance of local
languages, however provides little support for
functionalist theories, which emphasize the im-
portance of these languages in peripheral econo-
mies and societies.

There have been slight increases in the per-
centage of time that is to be devoted to mathe-
matics education, and some movement toward
increased similarity among countries in this
measure. The percentage of instructional time
devoted to natural science increased during the
period under study, and (the rather low) variabil-
ity declined overall. Similarly, there are modest
increases in time allocated to aesthetic and phys-
ical education. Variability here is also fairly low,
but does not show consistent declines.

The percentage of time allocated to combined
social science instruction shows little change over
the period of the study. Variation is low, but un-
changed over the period. Within this category, the
percentage of time devoted to history, geography,
or civics declines sharply, while that devoted to
“social studies” increases sharply. This striking
worldwide trend toward a more integrated notion
of society could have a functionalist interpreta-
tion, e.g., greater public involvement in and control
over social life produced a stronger conception of
society as a “social system.” It could also result
from worldwide cultural changes — perhaps re-
flecting a dominant American model of proper
curricular content that became institutionalized in
the 1960s (Wong forthcoming).
Aside from the common core of subjects, the
main finding in Table 2 is the low percentage of
time allocated to the less universal ones. Reli-
gious or moral education is still required in pri-
mary schools in about three-fourths of the coun-
tries, but the time allocated to it is low and de-
clining. This is also true of practical or vocation-
al subjects. Health or hygiene receives very-little
time. The fact that such less universal subjects
are not more prevalent in primary school curric-
ula speaks against historicist theories of educa-
tional development, which predict a wide range
of distinctive patterns.

Overall, Tables 1 and 2 suggest that an in-
creasingly similar world curriculum takes up most
of the instructional time. These findings suggest
that during much of the twentieth century a stan-
dard world curriculum for primary education has
been in operation. They provide some support
for functionalist arguments suggesting that pri-
mary school curricula should move in a “mod-
em” direction over time. But they call into ques-
tion the assumptions of historicist theories, which
tend to view the evolution of national school
curricula in terms of distinctive national trajec-
tories.

An important corollary of historicist concep-
tions of the curriculum predicts distinctive edu-
cational systems at a regional level as a result of
common cultural, political, or religious traditions,
rather than at a national level. Table 3 presents
the average percentage of instructional time de-
voted to subjects for major world regions for the
most recent period (1970-1986). Results for oth-
er periods (not shown) are similar. Countries are
classified in the following world regions: Sub-
Saharan Africa; the mainly Islamic countries of
the Middle East and North Africa; Asia; Latin
(Iberian) America; the non-Iberian Caribbean;
Eastern Europe; and “West” (which includes the
U.S. and the former British dominions of Cana-
da, Australia, and New Zealand).

Latin American countries allocate significant-
ly less instructional time to language education
(in total) than countries in other world regions.
One explanation is that because Latin America
experienced a long colonial period during which
indigenous populations were decimated by dis-
ease and warfare, Spanish became the dominant
language and the need to teach several languages
was minimized. Also, many newly independent
Third World nations, especially in Sub-Saharan
Africa and the Caribbean, have kept the language
of their former colonizers as an official language
of instruction in primary schools. Other former

colonies in the Middle East/North Africa and Asia
teach the former metropolitan language as a re-
quired foreign language. In general, however,
regional differences in the time devoted to lan-
guage education are small: most regions allo-
cate, on the average, about one-third of total cur-
ricular time to some type of language instruction.

In the other core areas of the curriculum —
mathematics, natural science, and social science
— curricular emphases are rather similar across
regions. Mathematics receives slightly more em-
phasis in Caribbean and Eastern European nations
(a pattern that predates the establishment of so-
cialist regimes). Emphasis on natural science and
social science is stronger in Latin American
countries (perhaps reflecting Enlightenment ra-
Historicist theories of the development of school
curricula predict high correlations over time in
the allocation of instructional time. Early battles
over the inclusion of particular school subjects
tend to dissipate over time. Once subjects are
incorporated into the official curriculum, the
amount of time devoted to them should change
slowly. Functionalist theories lead to similar pre-
dictions because, if national levels of develop-

3 Several nations in each historical period have of-
ficial primary school curricula in which particular
subject areas are allotted significantly more (or less)
curricular time than is the averages reported in Tables
2 and 3. However, in supplemental analyses, we find
that the number of countries that maintain an extreme
emphasis (or lack of emphasis) on a particular subject
over time is very small (Kamens 1990). Typically,
one of two processes occurs: (1) a country doesn’t
require a particular subject — science, for example
— in one time period but does in the next period,
usually allotting curricular time to that subject at a
level similar to world norms; or (2) a country contin-
ues to require a subject — vocational education, for
example — that has gone out of fashion in much of
the world. Delay in requiring new subjects or dropping
old subjects that have lost their value account for many
of the “deviant” curricular patterns.
ment determine curricular emphases, the former
do not change dramatically. On the other hand,
the idea that national curricula reflect worldwide
influences suggests low correlations in curricular
emphases because countries are drawing from
increasingly standardized global models rather
than from their own unique history or develop-
mental requirements.

Table 4 presents Pearsonian interperiod corre-
lations within curricular categories. These corre-
lations indicate the degree of stability over time
in the percentage of curricular time allocated to
these subjects. All but five of the 33 correlations
are below .50. Two of the exceptions concern the
inclusion of imperial or metropolitan languages
as official curricular languages in newly inde-
pendent countries — the group of countries re-
quiring instruction in a nonindigenous official
language remained stable in the post-World War
II period. Two relatively high correlations occur
for religious and moral education; further analy-
sis shows that this result is due to religious edu-
cation (Cha et al. 1988). Whether religious in-
struction is included in the school curriculum
depends on whether church and state are institu-
tionally and politically separated and tends to be
stable over time. Apart from these two subject
areas, the results suggest considerable volatility
over time. Correlations between the two postwar
periods tend to be a bit higher, but this may be
due to the shorter time span and the greater num-
ber of cases for these periods.

These generally low correlations support the
view that national curricula are shaped more by
worldwide processes than national ones. They
seem to result from a system in which country
curricular decisions reflect world standards rath-
er than national educational history.

 

The one subject area in which we noted a distinc-
tive curricular pattern is religious and moral educa-
tion. A few countries, mainly Islamic, allot a sub-
stantial part of the curriculum to religious instruction.
For example, Saudi Arabia (1945-1969; 1970-1986),
Egypt (1920-1944), Yemen (1970-1986), and Pales-
tine (1920-1944) devote more than one-fourth of the
primary curriculum to religious instruction.

Apart from religious and moral education, there is
little evidence of distinctive elementary school cur-
ricula, a striking finding in view of the fact that many
countries — for example, China, Korea, Japan, Is-
lamic countries — had unique systems of instruction
entirely outside the modern orbit at the time of their
incorporation into the modern world educational
system. At least in terms of official policies, the rich
and diverse cultural traditions of these countries are
minimally reflected in the elementary curriculum.
Are nations’ official curricula affected by na-
tional variations in political, economic and social
structure? For each period, several measures of
socioeconomic development were correlated with
the percentage of instructional time devoted to
particular subjects in the primary school curricu-
la. The three measures were: (1) Log of per capita
energy consumption (United Nations 1952, 1984).
This measure, for which relatively complete in-
formation is available for each time period, tends
to be highly correlated with other measures of
economic development. (2) Urbanization, mea-
sured as the percent of the population living in
cities larger than 100,000 (World Bank 1987).
Due to insufficient data for the 1920-1944 period
and the fact that this variable orders counties
consistently over time, 1950 data for this mea-
sure were employed for the earliest period. (3)
The proportion of the school-age population en-
rolled in primary school (Benavot and Riddle
1988; UNESCO 1987). This variable is widely
available, is positively related to other develop-
ment measures, and reflects the expansion and
perhaps modernization of the mass educational
system (which may have modemizing effects on
the curriculum over and above effects of devel-
opment in general).

The correlations presented in Table 5 lend lim-
ited support to functionalist theories. Such theo-
ries tend to predict that national curricula are
highly patterned: a group of “modern” subjects
are linked together in the curriculum and given
greater shares of instructional time as a result of
modernization and national development. If
mathematics, natural science, and, to a lesser de-
gree, social studies constitute an interrelated nexus
of “modern” subject matter, the results show that
socioeconomic development is not strongly cor-
related with an emphasis on “modern” subjects in
twentieth century curricula. Some positive cor-
relations along this line appear (e.g., between
mathematics instruction and energy consump-
tion in the first period), but they are not consistent
and do not remain in the current period.*

By contrast, socioeconomic development in the
post-World War II periods is positively associat-
ed with an emphasis on national languages and
negatively associated with an emphasis on offi-
cial or foreign language instruction. This has more
to do with changing models of nationhood and
nationalism in different historical periods than
with development per se (Kamens, Cha, and
Wong 1988). The amount of time devoted to
language education of all types in primary cur-
ricula is unrelated to socioeconomic development.

Socioeconomic development is also positively
correlated with the share of time devoted to aes-
thetic education. This may reflect broader values
and socialization patterns of modern societies.
However, such an effect of development is not
central to functionalist theories. In the post-World
War II periods, socioeconomic development is
negatively related to an emphasis on practical or
vocational education. This reflects two phenom-
ena: the “adapted” colonial curriculum of the pre-
independence era has not been fully replaced in
many former colonies and “practical” knowledge
relating to agriculture, farming, and household
work is emphasized by many agrarian nations
during the primary school cycle — in part be-
cause primary education in these countries is of-
ten a terminal educational phase. This effect,
while generally compatible with functionalist
thinking, i is once again not a central prediction.
Our main conclusion is that “modern” curricular
emphases are not closely related to variation in
national levels of development — a core idea in
most functionalist thought about educational de-
velopment.°

> Another prediction from both functionalist and
historical theories is that national independence itself
has a substantial effect on curricular policies and
practices, perhaps generating a more aggressively

vocational subjects is of marginal significance
since these relationships do not reflect core func-
tionalist ideas. There is a weak trend toward
“modernity” in the expansion of instructional time
for natural science, social science, and mathe-
matics. Furthermore, there is little national sta-
bility over time in the allocation of instructional
time. Thus, it is difficult to make a case for tight
linkages between official curricular emphases and
variation in functional societal requirements.

Historicist theories suggest diversity in national
curricula among countries or world regions and a
substantial degree of stability over time. Again,
these predictions are not substantially supported
by the data, aside from some long-term consis-
tency in the time devoted to religious instruction.

The idea that the curricula of mass education
are closely tied to standardized worldwide mod-
els of social and educational progress suggests
that instruction in such “modern” topics as math-
ematics, natural science, and social science will
diffuse throughout the world, that national pri-
mary curricula will be increasingly similar, and
that stability over time will be modest. Most of
our findings support this line of argument. While
there is some variation concerning minor subjects
— whether they are taught and how much time
they are allocated — instruction in core subject
areas appears in practically all national curricula
and there is a great deal of similarity in the amount
of time devoted to these core categories. Nation-
al characteristics are only weakly related to cur-
ricular emphases. Only the expectation of sharply
increased similarity over time receives limited
support; change is modest, though most coun-
tries include all the standard subjects in the cur-
riculum.

The notion that official primary curricula re-
flect a world educational order modifies rather
than eliminates functionalist and historicist hy-
potheses. Theorists can retain the notion of the
modern curriculum as functional: they need sim-
ply to understand that functionalist models hold
at the world level and are often adopted in pe-

 

The respective percentages for independent nations
were: 34.5, 35.7 and 34.9. Clearly, in many depen-
dent educational systems, extra time was devoted to
the language of the colonial metropole, which was
likely to be alien to most of the population. With
independence, the pressure to devote this time to what
had become a foreign language was eliminated or
reduced (Cha forthcoming). Beyond this single ef-
fect, there is little evidence that dependent polities
followed radically different curricular trajectories in
most subject areas.
ripheral areas as models rather than as responses
to changed national political or social realities.
Similarly, a historical perspective can still view
the curriculum as a contested historical product,
but the history involved in, say, the shift from
geography and history studies to social studies,
may be better viewed as the playing out of hege-
monic forces in a global arena. Most scholarship
in this camp sees history as a product of specific
interactions, but there is no logical reason to in-
sist that these intersections be primarily local or
national. The knowledge being selected, orga-
nized, and transmitted by different elementary
school systems has a good deal of worldwide
standardization. The modern pattern — much of
it already in place at the beginning of our study
— seems to involve the expansion of a language-
focused curriculum to include mathematics, nat-
ural science, social science, and physical and arts
education. The spread of this curricular pattern
around the world — mostly independent of re-
gional and developmental factors — effectively
incorporates modern functionalist theory as a
broad ideological base and as a general legiti-
mizing system.

We have no information on the processes by
which this curricular standardization is achieved.
The nation-state is the dominant form of societal
organization in the modern period — preferred
by political elites and advanced by all sorts of
social groups (Thomas et al. 1987). To some ex-
tent, this model carries implications for desirable
knowledge for the population, from a shared na-
tional culture to aspects of modern technical ra-
tionalism — perhaps these implications become
obvious in each nation-state, producing overall
similarity. Also, the prescription of mass educa-
tion is endemic, encouraged by international or-
ganizations, by professional elites, and by the
dominant powers throughout the modern period.
To some extent, the logic of mass education car-
ties implications for a common cultural content
(again emphasizing shared national culture and a
good deal of rationalism). Finally, to some ex-
tent the mass curriculum is directly defined and
prescribed through the influence of international
organizations (e.g., the World Bank and United
Nations organizations), through the models pro-
vided by dominant nation-states, and the educa-
tion professionals who operate on a worldwide
basis. All these influences (which are difficult to
distinguish empirically) find receptive audiences
in national societies and states eager for legiti-
macy and progress. As with individual identity
in Tocqueville’s vision of America, national
identity in the modern world-system is achieved
through conformity to the institutionalized ideals.

In one respect, the standardization of national
school curricula is not a complete surprise. Our
period is one in which local and primordial cul-
tures are undergoing wholesale destruction, in
part as a result of mass education. Local lan-
guages die out or are circumscribed, as are local
gods and spirits. Local political divisions are un-
dercut, usually in the name of a national polity,
along with parochial technologies and customs.
Every aspect of the modern world-system builds
conformity of economic, or political, or familial
and cultural rules to regional, ethnic, or national
standards (Thomas et al. 1987). Similarly, schools
claim to be laid out in standard ways at national
levels regardless of gender, class, tribe, region,
and locality. (In practice, however, there may be
curricular variation across such subgroups that is
not acknowledged in the official rules of mass
educational systems.)

The real surprise of our findings lies not in the
unimportance of local influences, but in the rela-
tive unimportance of national influences on cur-
ricular structure. Similarities clearly outweigh
differences. The few differences observed tend
to be unstable and seem to arise as a matter of
chance in national societies differing dramatical-
ly in wealth, political structure, and cultural and
teligious tradition. We may speak with some
confidence about a relatively standard world
curriculum.

Future research should examine trends in na-
tional curricula to analyze the world flow of cur-
riculum changes, and the importance of particu-
lar paths (e.g., particular international organiza-
tions, dominant powers, or professional groups).
Data on the intended content of subjects would
study whether the widespread shift from history
and geography instruction to social studies is a
change in content or in label. Data on the content
of actual classroom instruction would indicate
whether official policy actually penetrates to this
level. For example, how much local “resistance”
is there? How aware are local educators of
worldwide curricular trends apart from the par-
ticular policies of their authorities?

Our study suggests the value of direct indepen-
dent measures of world curricular standards over
time, since these appear to influence national
policies. What preferences are found in the dis-
cussions of the educational professionals, the
policies of the dominant powers in the world
stratification system, and the organizational stances
of the important international organizations?
