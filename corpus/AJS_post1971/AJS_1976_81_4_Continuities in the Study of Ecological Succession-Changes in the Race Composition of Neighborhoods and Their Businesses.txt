The nature and consequences of residential succession of populations are
well documented, but its impact on the character of local organizations is
less clearly understood. As the Duncans observed nearly two decades ago,
such a concomitant can be established only by empirical investigation:
“Accompanying residential succession may be changes in the density of
population, the composition of households, the way in which residential
structures are used, the character of local institutions, and the like. Such
changes, however, are not assumed to be invariable concomitants of suc-
cession; their occurrence and intensity must be established by research”
(1957, p. 108).

of Charles Barresi, Mary Beth Beres, Gerald Gordon, Ivan Light, Harvey Molotch,
Robert Stern, Gerald Suttles, Charles Tilly, and Eleanor Wolf. Because of space
limitations, this paper does not include a complete review of the previous literature
on ecological succession. For a comprehensive review, see Aldrich (1975). Support for
data collection and analysis of our four-wave panel study was made available by the
President’s Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice, the
Small Business Administration, the National Science Foundation, Yale University,
and the New York State School of Industrial Relations. Howard Schwartz and Carl
Kolchak provided valuable research assistance, and Carol Cashman patiently typed
her way through seemingly unending drafts.
HYPOTHESES ON SUCCESSION AND SMALL BUSINESS

A review of the literature on residential succession yields several empirical
generalizations to be investigated in this study of business succession, and
recent research on minority entrepreneurship suggests additional hypoth-
eses. Most of the supporting literature will not be cited here; it is
extensively reviewed in Aldrich (1975).

Once the process of succession is begun it is rarely, if ever, reversed;
succession follows a continuous line as the established group recedes and
the expanding group replaces it. Rates of housing turnover by the originally
dominant group are fairly stable, as the normally high rate of residential
mobility in urban populations provides ample opportunity for substantial
numbers of vacancies to occur in a relatively short time (Molotch 1972).
The proportion of minority occupancy rises because the whites who leave
are not replaced by other whites rather than because whites begin leaving
at a faster rate.

The pent-up demand for housing among minority populations that
prevents housing vacancy rates from falling is not matched by a proportion-
ately high demand for business opportunities. First, like white entre-
preneurs, blacks and Puerto Ricans face a pattern of metropolitan-wide
economic concentration and changes that are detrimental to local businesses
(Birch 1970). Second, would-be minority entrepreneurs face increasing
competition from businesses outside the area, particularly from shopping
centers made accessible by improved intraurban mobility. Third, lack
of business experience and discriminatory credit practices make minority
businesses extremely vulnerable to short-range misfortune (Cross 1969).

Several historical studies of blacks in business have found that the
American Journal of Sociology

removal of white-owned competition allows black businessmen to occupy
types of businesses previously closed to them (see Drake and Cayton 1945;
Light 1972, p. 14). As white businessmen leave the more desirable niches
in the business structure, we would expect black and Puerto Rican entre-
preneurs to move quickly to fill them.

White-owned small businesses are less free to move than the white
residential population because of the lower liquidity of their locational
investments. Businesses making a profit are unlikely to move owing to the
uncertainties associated with doing business at a new location (Zimmer
1964). Considering the tenuous viability of small businesses in aging urban
neighborhoods, we would expect economic factors to weigh more heavily
than racial change in small business survival, although we recognize the
interdependence of economic and racial change. This expectation is rein-
forced by evidence indicating that only a small proportion of white
residential withdrawal can be accounted for by racial attitudes such as
hostility to blacks or fear of them (“white panic”) (see Wolf and Lebeaux
1969).

This paper tests five hypotheses based on the review of the literature
mentioned above (Aldrich 1975) and on research concerning small busi-
nesses:

H,: An increase in the proportion of minority-owned small businesses
occurs because whites cease buying into business opportunities in racially
changing areas rather than because white businessmen accelerate their rate
of withdrawal.

Hy: Whereas the high pent-up demand for housing among minorities
produces a low housing vacancy rate during succession, the low pent-up
demand for business opportunities among minorities and the declining
market they face lead to an increase in the business vacancy rate.

Hs: The withdrawal of majority-group competition opens up opportuni-
ties for minority entrepreneurs and minority businesses eventually occupy
the abandoned niches, with the industry distribution for all businesses
remaining fairly stable as a result.

Hy: The changing economic status of a neighborhood and the profit
status of a business have a greater impact on small business survival than
does racial change.

H;: Attitudes of white small businessmen toward race or crime have no
impact on the probability of their leaving an area in racial transition from
white to black.
Race Composition of Neighborhood Businesses

businesses (or, strictly speaking, a set of business sites) in areas undergoing
race residential succession, not a population of area residents. Second, we
have four waves of observations on the same set of business sites, spaced
at a fairly close interval of two years between observations and thus pro-
viding a detailed picture of the process of succession (Duncan and Duncan
1957, p. 111).

The data for this study were obtained from interviews and observation
of a four-wave panel of business sites. In 1966 a probability sample of
businesses was surveyed in eight high crime rate police precincts of Boston,
Chicago, and Washington, D.C. Follow-up surveys were made in 1968,
1970, and 1972 in seven of these areas, a predominantly black and a pre-
dominantly white precinct in both Boston and Chicago and two predomi-
nantly black precincts and a primarily white one in Washington, D.C. The
areas in our sample include virtually all of the South Side of Boston, from
just below the central business district to the city border, all of Washington,
D.C., from S Street to the Maryland border, and much of the North and
West Sides of Chicago. Given the large territory covered in each city, we
feel our conclusions have high external validity. For a more complete
description of the sample, see Aldrich and Reiss (1971) and Aldrich
(1973).

The seven precincts retained from the original sample included 648
profit-oriented businesses, varying from 86 to 102 for each precinct. In-
terviews of the current owner or manager at each 1966 site were sought
in the follow-up studies of 1968 and 1970, yielding 432 interviews in
1968 and 431 in 1970. Excluding vacant sites, completion rates were,
respectively, 80% and 84%. Information about survival and business type
was recorded for every business site in 1968 and 1970, whether or not any-
one was interviewed. The procedure was modified slightly in 1972 when,
because of cost limitations, a short-form mailed questionnaire was used,
followed by on-site interviews for businesses not returning a questionnaire
or reporting a change in ownership. Since almost no new business sites
were developed in these areas between 1966 and 1972, the original sample
should provide reliable estimates of the experience of the local business
populations over this period.

To examine the effect of changes in race composition of residential areas
on the race composition of small businesses, each sampling area was
divided into its component census tracts. To portray aggregate changes
concomitant with residential and business succession, we classified each
census tract as representing one of six stages of residential succession as
of 1960. The definition of stages follows Duncan and Duncan (1957),
being based on the proportion of black residents in 1960 and 1970. A
brief definition of each stage is given in table 1.

Race Composition of Neighborhood Businesses

decreases across the stages of succession, except for the influx stage (table
1). This pattern reflects the initial scattering and uneven distribution of
blacks in the influx stage with more settlement concentration as residential
succession proceeds. Following Pryor’s (1971) suggestion, we classified
1966 business sites according to their distance from the “line of race move-
ment” by 1970.3 The validity of this classification is shown in the system-
atic decrease in the “distance” measure from influx to succession, even
though there is considerable variation within stages.

Income in constant dollars varies by stage of succession, with the median
income of families and unrelated individuals decreasing as succession pro-
ceeds. By comparing the rate of change of median family income in the
sample areas with that in the relevant SMSAs, we can derive a crude esti-
mate of the extent to which the census tracts in our study were affected by
the decentralizing forces described by Berry and Cohen (1973). For all
three SMSAs, the median family income between 1959 and 1969, in con-
stant dollars, rose 32% as compared with an average rate of increase of
only 8% for the census tracts in our sample. Although median family
income increased in all stages of succession, only in the final stage, termed
“succession,” is the increase more than 12%. When this relative loss in
median family income is coupled with the declining population of nearly
all tracts, the result is lessened economic attractiveness relative to other
business sites in the metropolitan area.
The turnover rate for white-owned businesses is fairly stable over the
four waves of our panel, as shown in table 2. At the aggregate level, the
proportion of businesses with the same white owner as in the previous panel
is remarkably similar, except for areas of high majority succession between
1970 and 1972. Only in the late stages of race residential succession does
the white rate of leaving increase significantly. The pattern of white
population withdrawal during residential succession thus holds true of the
business population as well, and hypothesis 1 is upheld.

Major change occurs, however, in the market for available business sites
in the changing areas. Just as white families do not seek housing in racially
changing areas, so apparently most white businessmen no longer view
changing neighborhoods as viable business locations. The percentage of new
business owners belonging to either the black or the Puerto Rican minority
increased between 1968 and 1972 through all stages of succession. Within
each wave there is a substantial hiatus between the influx stage, during
which blacks are only a very small proportion of the 1970 population, and
the other five stages. Of 143 minority-owned or operated firms in 1972,
132 were black- and 11 Puerto Rican-owned or managed, but the Puerto
Ricans were located only in the influx and low minority areas. Thus by
1972 the market of new buyers in the high majority through succession
stages is composed entirely of blacks.

The fairly stable rate of white owners leaving and the increasing rate at
which blacks or Puerto Ricans replace them as buyers of available busi-
nesses interact to produce a steady decline in the proportion of white-owned
or operated businesses in all areas. Note that although our panel began in
1966, the process of succession had begun earlier in all but the influx areas,
having started most recently in the low minority succession areas but before
1950 in the high majority and succession areas. The 1966 cross section
reflects these historical differences in succession, showing considerable
decrease in the percentage of white-owned businesses through stages of
succession.

Even though blacks and, in the early stages, Puerto Ricans begin buying
businesses in areas undergoing residential and business succession, their
buying is limited and does not absorb the large number of sites vacated.
Therefore, as shown in table 3, only a minority of sites vacated by busi-
nesses (both white and black or Puerto Rican owned) are reoccupied by
new profit-oriented businesses. There was a temporary increase in the
proportion of sites reoccupied between 1968 and 1970, but in the 1970-72
period the reoccupation rate fell again to about one-quarter of all available
sites in the high minority through succession stages. Only during the influx
stage is the reoccupation rate sufficient to absorb half or more of the
available sites.

As a consequence of the low reoccupation rate, vacancy rates rise in all

BUSINESS POPULATION CHANGES: INDUSTRY COMPOSITION

A business population responds to race residential succession not only
by a decrease in absolute size and by changes in the race composition of
ownership but also by changing its industry composition. With changes
in population composition come changes in consumer and labor markets
that have more impact on white-owned retail and service businesses than
on such white-owned industries as construction, manufacturing, or whole-
sale trade (Aldrich 1973). Consequently, white-owned retail and service
firms decrease in number, not only absolutely but also relative to other
kinds of businesses.

Changes in the population of black- and Puerto Rican—owned businesses
during race residential succession are somewhat different from those for
white-owned businesses, as the withdrawal of white-owned businesses opens
up opportunities heretofore closed to minorities. In the early stages of
succession, the population of black- and Puerto Rican—-owned businesses
increases in absolute size; in the later stages it decreases more slowly than
that of white-owned businesses, even though the business failure rate is
higher for minority-owned firms than for white-owned ones. Tables 4 and
5 provide information on the changing industry composition of white- and
minority-owned businesses that is needed for testing hypothesis 3.

Businesses are classified into seven industry categories‘ in table 4, and
4 The categories are retail businesses, comprising (1) consumer goods, (2) food sales,
(3) restaurants and bars, (4) other retail; service businesses, comprising (5) personal

services and (6) business services; (7) other businesses, including construction, manu-
facturing and wholesale trade.

indices of dissimilarity for these categories are presented in table 5. The
industry composition of white-owned businesses in the influx stage is highly
stable across the six years of our panel: the index of dissimilarity is never
larger than 4.0 for comparisons between adjacent waves, indicating that
all types of firms decline at about the same rate. Industry composition is
less stable for all other stages, since the percentage of retail and service
businesses decreases more rapidly than that of other kinds. Most of the
dissimilarity between waves is due to a decline in the number of two
kinds of retail businesses owned by whites: consumer goods and food sales.
The industry distribution for white-owned businesses changes sharply,
however, only in the final succession stage, in which the number of con-
sumer-goods businesses drops from 10 in 1966 to one in 1972 and the
number of food-sales businesses drops from six to one.

For the black- and Puerto Rican—owned businesses, changes in industry
composition between 1966 and 1972 in the first four stages occur because
businesses are being added in the subpopulations from which whites are
withdrawing, consumer goods and retail food sales, so that this business
population increases. In the last two stages of succession, however, the
absolute number of black-owned businesses also decreases, although the
number and relative proportion of consumer-goods firms remain fairly
stable and food sales firms increase in absolute numbers. In particular, in
1968 there were no black-owned liquor stores, whereas in 1970 there were
six, and in 1972 five were still in business. The more volatile pattern of
change in the black- and Puerto Rican—owned business population is re-
flected in the larger indexes of dissimilarity between waves for their in-
dustry distribution, relative to those for whites.®

One implication of these changes is that the industry distributions for
white- and for black- or Puerto Rican-owned businesses are complementary.
Blacks and Puerto Ricans move into the types of businesses vacated by
whites and consequently meet with less competition from local white-owned
businesses (Light 1972; see also Tilly, Jackson, and Kay 1965, on the
process of occupational succession). This process can be shown in two ways
by means of the information in columns 9-16 of table 5. First, as shown
in columns 9-12, the industry composition of the two business populations
diverges between 1966 and 1972 in the four later stages of succession (there
Hypotheses 4 and 5 concern the prediction of individual business survival,
rather than changes at the population level. Close to 10% of the original
1966 cohort of white-owned businesses left each year, with a total loss of
51% of the white-owned business cohort of 1966 by 1972. In this section
we examine the extent to which local economic, racial, and attitude changes
account for business failure. The dependent variable is whether white-
owned businesses at the sample sites in 1966 were still at those sites in
1972,5 a 0,1 variable, with 1 indicating that a business is no longer at its
site (X, in the correlation matrix of table 6).

The literature on race residential succession and organization-environ-
ment interaction suggests five sets of variables that might predict the sur-
vival of small businesses in areas undergoing race residential succession.
First, given the location of such areas in a central city, national economic
and demographic trends reduce their chances of survival. The decentraliza-
tion of economic activity to the suburbs works against central city survival,
and the growing scale of business enterprise places further constraints on

6 Note that the issue, strictly speaking, is survival at the site, as businesses no longer
at the 1966 site could have moved out of the area to another site. The difficulties of
tracking down businesses that had left their sites prevent us from focusing on the move
versus fail issue, but an analysis of the data from the set of businesses whose ultimate
fate we were able to determine indicates there is no discernible bias in our use of the
survival-at-the-site criterion.

the survival of small business entrepreneurship. Since we do not measure
these changes in this study, we can only speculate about their effect on the
basis of our failure to account for all of the variance through local forces.

Second, the variable we hypothesize to have a major impact on business
survival is the economic status of the incoming population compared with
that of the previous residents (hypothesis 4). Our measures of economic
status (X, and X;) are the median income of all families and unrelated
individuals in a census tract in 1960 and changes in economic status be-
tween 1960 and 1970, the latter measured by residualizing 1970 income
on a tract’s value for 1960 (Bohrnstedt 1969, p. 118).

A counterhypothesis to hypothesis 4, the possibility that the changing
racial composition of an area explains white businessmen’s withdrawal,
suggests a third set of variables. Findings from previous investigations are
inconsistent concerning the impact of the race of the incoming population.
If race per se is an important factor inducing businesses to leave a neighbor-
hood in transition from white to black residents, then both the 1960 per-
centage of blacks in a census tract (X2) and the change between 1960 and
1970 (X3; again, residualized) should have a positive impact on a business
leaving its 1966 site. A business’s distance from the line of movement in
settlement (X,) should‘also predict 1972 survival, if race considerations
are so paramount in the minds of white businessmen that they leave in
anticipation of race change. As we show below in discussing the discrimi-
nant analysis (table 7), none of these three race variables is a significant
predictor of 1966-72 survival, once economic status and change are taken
into account.

Hypothesis 5 suggests that a fourth set of variables may be labeled the
“panic syndrome,” since they measure the impact of white businessmen’s
fear of crime and of black in-movement on the probability of their leaving
the area. Findings from previous studies of race residential succession pre-
dict a low correlation between such fear or panic and business’s survival in
race residential succession. Two questions from the 1966 interviews were
used as indicators of a white businessman’s fear of and hostility to blacks:
first, whether the businessman believed crime in the area was decreasing,
stable, or increasing, and second, his opinion of the civil rights movement
and its impact on police work. These two variables are not shown in table
6 because their correlation with business survival (X,) is essentially zero
(—.01 and .01). The test of the panic hypothesis (hypothesis 5) proved
negative, lending further weight to arguments that residential succession
is a “normal process” in the central city, a point returned to in our con-
cluding section.

Variables X;—X,g, constituting a fifth set, measure elements of a business
organization’s structure and management. Businessmen were asked in 1966
whether they “had thought of moving” (X;7); the low correlation between
X, and X, indicates that some carry out their intent. Also, Xz is positively
correlated with the 1960 percentage of blacks and negatively correlated
with 1960 median income, income change, and distance from the line of
race movement. Earlier it was found that whites left the retail trades in
greater proportions than other types of business, and the .10 correlation
between X, (retail business) and X, reinforces this conclusion to some
extent. Service businesses (Xy) were no more likely to leave than other
types, casting doubt on any inference that businesses requiring close con-
tact with customers are more sensitive to race residential succession than
other types of business. A more direct indicator of dependence on local
customers, the percentage of customers residing within a mile of a business
site (Xj), also has a low correlation with business survival.

Business age (X10), proportion of relatives employed (X;3), number of
employees (X12), and chain ownership (X14) have negligible correlations
with the dependent variable. As predicted in hypothesis 4, the most sub-
stantial organizational predictor of survival is whether a business made a
profit in 1965-66. The correlation between X5 (profit in 1966) and X;, is
—.21. The final organizational variable examined is whether a business was
a riot target in the civil disorders of 1968 (X14). Earlier analyses showed
that being a riot target had a substantial short-run financial impact on
small businesses in riot-torn areas (Aldrich and Reiss 1971; Berk and
Aldrich 1972), but the long-run direct effect is negligible in reducing the
business population.

Of the 15 variables examined for their impact on whether a business
survived to 1972 at its 1966 sample site (table 6), nine were statistically
significant at the .10 level and therefore were chosen for a stepwise dis-
criminant function analysis. The first variables entered were X, and X;—
the indicators of census-tract median income and income change—because
of our hypothesis that the concomitant of residential succession with the
most immediate impact on small businesses is the expansion of a lower
socioeconomic group into an area: we did not wish to confound the effect
of race change with aggregate income change. The second set of variables
to be entered, one at a time, were those characterizing the race impact of
succession (X», X3, and X¢), but none of them remained: each was dropped
because it made no statistically significant contribution to the discriminant
function after X, and Xs were entered. The entry of the organizational
variables was controlled so that business type entered first; only retail
business (Xs) remained in the analysis. After all other organizational
variables had been entered, X; and X15 were entered. This order was chosen
because it could be argued that both desire to move and profit are results
of other organizational variables, for example, chain ownership.

Only five variables remained from the stepwise analysis for the analyses
displayed in table 7. Since discriminant function analysis and regression
analysis are formally equivalent when only two groups are involved (using
a 0,1 dummy variable in regression), we present coefficients from a re-
gression analysis of these variables so that the reader may more easily in-
terpret the results. Also presented is the conditional F, or the F-value at
which a variable entered the function. The relative values of F and the B-
coefficient make possible an assessment of each variable’s relative im-
portance.”

Two conclusions emerge from examination of the zero-order correlations
and the discriminant function analysis. First, the race composition of a
business’s environment in 1960 and subsequent change between 1960 and
1970 are not important predictors of 1972 survival at the 1966 site,
supporting hypothesis 4. Nor is distance from the line of movement a sig-
nificant predictor. This finding is congruent with research on race resi-
dential succession showing that changes in race composition per se are
unimportant in accounting for white families leaving areas with in-
movement by blacks even though race residential succession has an impact
on whites’ desires to move into a neighborhood undergoing succession. The
fact that the economic status of a business’s environment in 1960 and
subsequent change in it between 1960 and 1970 do have an impact on
survival confirms hypothesis 4.

Second, the best predictor of whether a business survived during race
residential succession is whether it was profitable in 1966. Two intra-
organizational variables, retail trade composition and the owner’s ex-
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

Ecological succession in the residential and business populations of the
central city is an aspect of more general processes of urban differentiation
and change. This paper has investigated whether the process of succession
in the small-business population is similar to that of residential succession.
Our major finding is that the two processes are quite similar, both being
orderly sequences of change through which communities pass as a con-
sequence of population growth and movement.

Some, but not all, studies of race residential succession find that attitudes
of residents change as an area undergoes race residential succession. We
found that white businessmen’s perceptions of their neighborhoods are
affected in some ways by such changes, since white businessmen perceive
general deterioration of the neighborhood and rising crime rates in all
stages of succession.’ Yet we also found that such fears had no discernible
impact on whether a business left the area between 1966 and 1972. In this
respect our findings are congruent with those of earlier investigations of
race residential succession which show that attitudes toward blacks are a
poor predictor of which white residents will move.

The business population generally changes in the same manner as the
residential population, with businesses leaving at a fairly low but constant
rate and with no evidence of panic selling. The proportion of white-owned
businesses decreases not because whites /eave but because when they do,
whites do not enter these areas as new business owners. In areas undergoing
race residential succession, the market for newly vacant housing units and
small businesses is almost entirely black.

Whereas the housing vacancy rate does not increase and in fact often
decreases during race residential succession, the same is not true of small
businesses. There may well be a pent-up demand for small-business op-
portunities among blacks, but the probability of realizing such aspirations
is much less likely for business than for housing units. Minorities lack
both the capital requirements and the business experience to fill business
opportunities opened to them by the withdrawal of whites. The black- and
Puerto Rican—owned business population does increase slightly in the early
stages of succession, but not enough to absorb all the businesses left by
whites.

The rate of departure of white-owned businesses is fairly constant across
types of industry in the early stages of succession, with retail and service
businesses only slightly more likely to leave; in later stages, however, the
loss of retail and service businesses is substantial and disproportionate,
compared with other kinds of business. Not surprisingly, much of the gain
in the black- and Puerto Rican—owned business population occurs in pre-
cisely these industries, as minority entrepreneurs take advantage of newly
vacated niches. The industry distributions for white- and nonwhite-owned
businesses are thus complementary as succession proceeds.

The white-owned businesses sampled in 1966 which were no longer at
the sample sites in 1972 probably left because of conditions associated with
operating a small business and metropolitan area changes more than be-
cause of neighborhood changes. The income distribution of neighborhood
residents and changes in it as well as profit status explain some departures,
but many simply reflect the high risk of small-business enterprise. The rate
of leaving, whether to move or to go out of business, is a little over one in
10 every year. During periods of economic growth, such a rate would go
unnoticed in most urban areas, since most business sites do not remain
vacant but are soon occupied by aspiring entrepreneurs hoping to succeed
where others have failed.

The future of the small-business population in areas undergoing race
residential succession can be predicted if the trends we have uncovered
continue. First, the business population will continue to decline in absolute
size as whites leave and the replacement rate remains low. For central
city residents, disadvantages follow in both the labor and consumer goods
markets (Aldrich 1973). The loss of jobs in the area causes local residents
to seek employment elsewhere. The loss of retail and service businesses
means longer shopping trips for consumers, especially if they wish to shop
in the high-volume, low-markup businesses in large shopping centers on
the fringes of the city.

Second, the departure of white entrepreneurs opens new business oppor-
tunities for blacks and other cultural minorities such as Puerto Ricans.
Government promotion of minority entrepreneurship has encouraged some
to go into business for themselves. Two barriers to minority-business suc-
cess remain, however, even with an absolute loss of competitive businesses.
Credit remains as difficult as ever to obtain—about 90% of the new mi-
nority businessmen at every wave of our panel relied solely on personal
savings or funds from friends and relatives to capitalize their businesses.
