The effects of parental socioeconomic characteristics on highest grade of formal
school completed are stable over cohorts born during the first half of the twentieth
century. Mathematical analysis and empirical findings based on the 1973
Occupational Changes in a Generation Survey show that linear models of the
educational attainment process are stable over cohorts because their coefficients
depend upon quantities which vary over time in offsetting directions. The
coefficients are weighted sums of the associations between socioeconomic
background and school continuation decisions where the weights are functions of
the school continuation probabilities. Intercohort increases in school
continuation rates by themselves imply declining background effects on
educational attainment, but, over cohorts, the associations between background
and continuation increase to offset the dampening effect of the changing marginal
distribution of schooling. Stable linear model effects are the result.
stratification in the United States, how-
ever, emphasizes the stability of the pro-
cess of stratification in general and the
effects of parental socioeconomic back-
ground on the formal schooling of off-
spring in particular. During the twentieth
century, average schooling levels have in-
creased dramatically over cohorts while
the dispersion of the schooling distribu-
tion has lessened. Racial and regional
schooling differentials have also di-
minished. Differences in attainment
among persons from different socioeco-
nomic origins, however, show little trend.
The effects of fathers’ schooling and oc-
cupational standing upon how far sons go
in school apparently change very little
over cohorts born during the first half of
the twentieth century (Duncan, 1965,
1967; Hauser and Featherman, 1976).
Although educational stratification with
respect to socioeconomic origins appears
stable, the reasons for stability in the edu-
cational attainment process are largely
unknown. Research to date has lacked
models of the mechanisms giving rise to
the observed patterns. Research so far has
also not shown how the observed stability
turns on the specific measures and statis-
tical models commonly used in empirical
analyses. In addition, it has not explored
the kinds of hypothetical demographic and
behavioral changes which could modify
the existing regime of social influences on
educational attainment. Instead, though it
is possible to identify stable statistical re-
lationships between family background
and educational attainment, current
understanding of trends in educational
stratification is, in the main, atheoretical.

Although most research demonstrates
invariant relationships between socioeco-
nomic origins and formal school attain-
ment, there have, nonetheless, been con-
flicting views of the trend in equality of
educational opportunity. Boudon (1974)
argued that inequality of educational op-
portunity declines steadily over time. For
some levels of schooling, Spady (1967)
found intercohort increases in attainment
differences among socioeconomic groups.
These discrepant findings result from dif-
ferences in how formal schooling is mea-
sured (Hauser, 1976; Boudon, 1976).
There has been little attempt, however, to
show explicitly how conclusions about the
trend in educational inequality depend on
the measurement of schooling and models
of social background effects. There has
also been little attempt to elucidate which
aspects of inequality are tapped by alter-
native models and measures of educa-
tional inequality. Given these ambiguities,
do empirical studies of the educational
attainment process adequately represent
aspects of educational inequality of
greatest interest? How should discrepant
findings be interpreted in light of a broader
understanding of stability and change in
social stratification?

This article addresses these questions
through an analysis of both the meaning of
and the relationships among alternative
statistical models of educational attain-
ment as well as through further statistical
analysis of the trend in socioeconomic
background effects on formal school at-
tainment. In so doing it casts light upon
the observed stability of parental socio-
economic effects on educational attain-
ment. Moreover, the effects on socioeco-
nomic background on formal schooling are
shown to vary systematically over cohorts
born-during the twentieth century. The
article has a two-fold purpose: to com-
plement previous descriptions of inter-
cohort changes in the effects of social
background on formal schooling, and to
interpret the patterns revealed by alterna-
tive analyses.
There are two aspects to formal educa-
tional stratification. One is the dispersion
of the formal schooling distribution--that
is, the variance of the marginal distribu-
tion of formal schooling. The other aspect
is the extent to which, for a given degree
of dispersion of the formal schooling dis-
tribution, some sociodemographic groups
are allocated more schooling than
others—that is, the association between
formal educational attainment and other
social statuses. The allocation and distri-
bution of schooling are conceptually inde-
pendent and, over time, may change in
response to distinct demographic and be-
havioral changes. For example, regardless
of whether schooling is allocated at ran-
dom or on the basis of ascriptive criteria
such as race or socioeconomic back-
ground, schooling may be more or less
unequally distributed. Over cohorts, even
if the principles by which schooling is al-
located are invariant, the distribution of
schooling may become more equal. Con-
versely, even if the degree of variation in
the formal schooling distribution were
completely fixed over cohorts, the princi-
ples by which individuals are allocated
places in the distribution could radically
change. The distinction between the allo-
cation and distribution of schooling is
analogous to the distinction between the
process of occupational recruitment and
the marginal distribution of occupational
positions typically made in the analyses of
occupational mobility (e.g., Hauser et al.
[1975]; Parkin [1971]).

Because educational ‘stratification con-
sists of two conceptually independent as-
pects, models of change in educational in-
equality should be specified with respect
‘to the aspect for which they are designed
to account, and the ways in which
selected measures of educational stratifi-
cation reflect that distribution and alloca-
tion of schooling should be made explicit.
The main concern here is to understand
further changes in socioeconomic dif-
ferentials in formal schooling—that is, to
explain change in the way that formal
schooling is allocated to persons from
various socioeconomic groups. It is im-
portant, therefore, not to confound
changes in the distribution of formal
schooling with changes in the principles
upon which schooling is allocated among
groups.

This section reviews several statistical
models of the relationship between social
background and formal schooling. It first
considers the logistic response model of
school continuation (grade progression)
which is used in the analyses reported
below, and then reviews the linear proba-
bility model of school continuation (grade
progression) and the linear model of high-
est grade of school completed, which are
two models of the background-schooling
relationship used in past research. This
review reconciles apparently contradic-
tory findings on changes in the effects of
social origins on schooling. In addition, it
illuminates the stability of educational
stratification by showing how linear social
background effects on highest grade com-
pleted depend upon a changing underlying
regime of grade progression rates and
background effects on progression rates.
where A, is a constant and A,j denotes the
effect of a unit change in Xy on the log
odds of grade progression. If the model is
properly specified, estimates of the A,j are
invariant under changes in the marginal
distributions of the variables in the model
(Bishop et al., 1975:9-15). Thus, social
background effects on school continuation
do not depend upon the average continua-
tion rate. On the other hand, if the proba-
bility of grade progression were the de-
pendent variable, then social background
effects would depend upon the average
continuation rate. Under the logistic re-
sponse model, differences in background
effects, either over school transitions or
over cohorts, cannot result from changing
marginal distributions of either indepen-
dent or dependent variables because such
changes do not affect the Ax. Because
differences in effect result from genuine
differences in the associations between
measured variables over populations,
Equation 1 permits intercohort compari-
sons of the effects of socioeconomic ori-
gins.

Corresponding to the technical issue of
model specification is the substantive
issue just discussed. To document change
in the allocation of formal schooling
among socioeconomic groups indepen-
dent of changing schooling distributions
requires estimates of the effects of social
origins on school continuation that are un-
affected by the overall proportion of per-
sons who continue from one level to the
next. Because Equation 1 denotes social
background effects that reflect the associ-
ation between background and grade
progression at each schooling level and
not the schooling distribution itself, it is an
empirical counterpart to the aspects of
educational stratification of interest.
Analysés reported here use estimates of
the A, to indicate the true effects of so-
cioeconomic background on school at-
tainment.

The logistic response model also illumi-
nates the observed stability of social
background—schooling relationships
measured by other models. This will be
shown by considering the relations among
alternative models of background effects
on schooling.
rapidly for persons from lower than from
higher social origins. Since the origin-
specific continuation probabilities con-
verge, Boudon concludes (p. 102) that
‘‘inequality of educational opportunity
decreases steadily over time.’’ Although
one can question the representativeness
or quality of Boudon’s data or the wisdom
of. using simulated data (Hauser, 1976),
these conclusions would likely follow
from high-quality data on grade progres-
sion trends by social background for most
Western societies.

The observed decline in inequality of
educational opportunity, however, is dic-
tated by secular increases in school con-
tinuation probabilities and the assump-
tions of Equation 2. The continuation
probabilities of all socioeconomic groups
increase over cohorts, but increases are
relatively small for higher-background
strata because the probabilities for these
strata are closer to a ceiling of unity.
Thus, difference in continuation proba-
bilities between higher- and lower-status
groups declines over cohorts. This decline
in background-continuation differentials
need not reflect a change in the principles
by which formal schooling is allocated to
persons from differing socioeconomic
backgrounds. Instead, it reflects changes
in the marginal distribution of formal
schooling. Even were the true association
between social background and school
continuation invariant over cohorts, by
this formulation the estimated effects of
background decline because of increasing
continuation probabilities. To see this
formally, consider the following reexpres-
sion Equation 1:
When grade progression proportions ex-
ceed 0.5, as they do for most school tran-
sitions in the twentieth-century United
States, the righthand side of Equation 7 is
negative and the linear effect of back-
ground declines over cohorts as grade
progression proportions increase. Thus,
Boudon’s finding of a decline in inequality
of educational opportunity follows
straightforwardly from increases in
grade-progression rates, in the absence of
changes in the association between back-
ground and grade progression.

Second, if the A,; are, in fact, increasing
over cohorts, then increases in Ay need
not reduce the byy. If grade-progression
proportions are as high as, say, 0.9,
changes in A, large enough to offset the
negative effect denoted by Equation 7
would have to be very large. Moderate
increases in A, would be obscured by
focusing on estimates of Equation 2.

Approaches to change in educational
inequality which focus on differences in
grade-progression probabilities reflect
changes in progression rates rather than
the extent to which, for a given schooling
distribution, educational opportunities are
allocated on the basis of socioeconomic
origins. Therefore, while Boudon’s con-
clusions are not incorrect, they may
obscure important changes in the effects
of socioeconomic status on attainment.
where Yj, is the highest grade of schooling
for the ith individual in the tth cohort, Bs
is the effect of a unit shift in Xj. on Yit, Bot
is a constant, €; is a stochastic distur-
bance, and the remaining notation is as in
Equations 1 and 2. Changes in the B,, over
cohorts, therefore, represent changes in
inequality of educational opportunity.
Available evidence shows that parental
socioeconomic characteristics and family
size have stable effects on educational at-
tainment over cohorts for American men
born during the twentieth century. By
contrast, the effects of other background
factors—such as family stability, farm ori-
gin, southern origin, and race—decline
(Hauser and Featherman, 1976:109).

Table 1 reports regressions of highest
grade of school completed on selected so-
cioeconomic social background factors for
white males born 1907-51. The estimates
are based on the 1973 Occupational
Changes in a Generation Survey (OCG), a
supplement to the March Current Popula-
tion Survey, which covered civilian
noninstitutional males aged 20 to 65
(Featherman and Hauser, 1975). Variable
descriptions are given in the note to Table
1. The estimates are consistent with the
pattern of parental socioeconomic-
background effects emphasized by Dun-
can (1965, 1967), Hauser (1970, 1976), and
Hauser and Featherman (1976). The ef-
fects of mother’s schooling and family in-
come, not examined in previous analyses,
have no trend, though several intercohort
fluctuations are statistically significant.
The effect of father’s occupational socio-
economic index declines slightly from
early cohorts to the more recent ones. On
balance, however, the calculations indi-
cate little change in the educational at-
tainment process.
What is the source of this stability in the
effects of parental socioeconomic char-
acteristics? To answer this, a useful strat-
egy is to examine the linear model of high-
est grade completed in more detail and to
explore the demographic forces which
determine the observed linear relation-
ship. In particular, it is possible. to derive
the formal relationship between the linear
model parameters By, the logistic re-
sponse model parameters A,j, and the
grade-progression proportions p;. Given
this relationship and known trends in
grade-progression proportions, it is pos-
sible to infer offsetting trends in the
components of 8, which result in inter-
cohort stability of the linear model.

able on highest grade completed is, from

Note: Father's occupation is measured as his Duncan socioeconomic index when respondent was 16;
parental income, as thousands of constant (1967) dollars when respondent was 16; mother’s and father’s
schooling, as grades completed. Each equation also includes respondent’s number of siblings; whether or not
he was born in the South; and whether or not he lived on a farm when he was 16. Ratios of coefficients to their
standard errors are in parentheses.
which, since Equations 9 and 13 both de-
note the effect of X, on Y, is simply an
approximation for B,. Thus, the linear ef-
fects of background on highest grade
completed are weighted sums of the logis-
tic response-model parameters for grade
progression, where the weights are
functions of the grade-progression
proportions.

Equation 13 shows that linear effects of
socioeconomic background on highest
grade of schooling completed (B,,) reflect
both the associations between background
factors and grade progression (A,j) and the
proportions making each school transition
(px). Hence, the linear model of highest
grade completed, commonly used to mea-
sure educational stratification, is affected
by both the extent that schooling is allo-
cated differentially by socioeconomic
background and the dispersion of the
schooling distribution.

Over cohorts it is not clear how the Agjt
vary—empirical results on this are pre-
sented below. The pj, however, have in-
creased considerably over cohorts born
during the first half of this century. (See,
for example, Table 3 and Duncan [1968].)
Because the changes in the p; have been
large, it is appropriate to ask what their
partial effect on.B, has been. The effect of
the vth grade progression proportion on
the relationship between Y; and X,y is
ciently balanced effects to ensure that
Equation 14 is zero. Thus, it is necessary
to evaluate Equation 14 numerically.
Table 2 presents the partial derivatives
Equation 14 for four parental socioeco-
nomic factors using the p; for six school tran-
sitions. These calculations use estimates
of the A,; and the p; for white males born
1907-51 as reported in the first row of
Table 3 (discussed later).? (For discussion
and interpretation of the 1907-51 esti-
mates in Table 3, see Mare [1980].) The
derivatives denote the impact of a 0.01
change in the probability of grade progres-
sion on the linear effect of each parental
socioeconomic variable on highest grade
of school completed. For example, 0.01
change in the proportion of persons com-
pleting eighth grade would, assuming con-
stant A,;, decrease the effect of parental
income on highest grade completed by
0.0056. The estimates in Table 2 strongly
imply that Equation 14 is negative for pa-
rental income and mother’s and father’s
schooling effects. At precollege schooling
levels, where socioeconomic background
effects are strongest and the increases in
grade progression rates have been greatest
(Mare [1977; 1980], and Table 3), the ef-
fects of grade-progression rates on the
linear effects of these socioeconomic fac-
tors are negative. To see the quantitative
importance of these effects, compare their

values to the regression coefficients re-
ported in Table 1. For example, the .0056
decrement in the family income effect in
response to a one-percentage-point rise in
the proportion completing eighth grade is
between 5% and 10% of the income coef-
ficients shown in the second column of
Table 1. At that transition, changes in the
linear effects of father’s schooling, moth-
er’s schooling, and father’s occupation
implied by the derivatives are approx-
imately 5, 5, and 1%, respectively. At the
transitions between eighth and ninth
grades and between ninth and twelfth
grades, the derivatives are smaller and
imply smaller decrements in the linear ef-
fects. If, however, the derivatives repre-
sent the impact of changes in progression
proportions over a half century, then the
total effect of progression rate changes
would, in the absence of offsetting forces,
be substantial. For example, the partial
derivative of the father’s schooling effect
with respect to the progression proportion
for eighth to ninth grade implies a .0029
decrement in the father’s schooling effect
per one percentage-point change in the
proportion continuing. This is only about
2% of the linear effect of father’s school-
ing on highest grade completed: Over
cohorts born 1907-1951, however, the
progression proportion increases from
0.79 to 0.98, implying almost a 40% de-
cline in the linear effect.
Of course, the effects of parental socio-
economic characteristics on highest grade
completed have not undergone the mas-
sive decline that the derivatives in Table 2
and growth in progression rates imply.
Computations based on Equation 14
merely show that, in the absence of
offsetting changes, growth in progression
rates, combined with the cross-sectional
pattern of declines in background effects
from lower to higher schooling levels,
would reduce linear effects of background
on highest grade completed. Evidently,
there are other sources of change in Bs
which offset these effects. The associ-
ations between background and grade
progression, Aj, may increase over
cohorts to offset the negative effects of
increases in p; on the f,.

That the A, for parental socioeconomic
characteristics may increase means that
socioeconomic factors are becoming more
important in determining who continues
from one schooling level to the next. No
theoretical claim that this occurs has been
presented, but the accounting Equations
13 and 14, cross-sectional observations,
the observed stability of parental socio-
economic effects on highest grade com-
pleted, and the secular increase in grade-
progression rates imply that increases in
the associations between background and
grade progression may .be necessary to
preserve stable linear effects. The trend in
The estimated trends in the effects of so-
cioeconomic background on grade pro-
gression for selected school transitions are
based on the 1973 OCG Survey for white
males. Analysis and interpretation of
trends are provided in Mare (1977; forth-
coming). The transitions are: (1) elemen-
tary school completion (8th grade); (2)
high school attendance, given elementary
completion (8th to 9th grade); (3) high
school graduation, given high school at-
tendance (9th to 12th grade); (4) college
attendance, given high school graduation
(12th to 13th grade); (5) college gradua-
tion, given college attendance (13th to
16th grade); and (6) graduate school at-
tendance, given college graduation (16th
to 17th grade). The socioeconomic back-
ground factors are those considered in the
analyses reported earlier—father’s occu-
pational status, parental income, and
mother’s and father’s grades of schooling.
The estimates of socioeconomic back-
ground effects were obtained in equations
which also estimated the effects of re-
spondent’s number of siblings, and
whether or not he was born in the South,
grew up on a farm, and suffered the ab-
sence of a parent during childhood. Vari-
able definitions are given at the bottom of
Table 3.

The effects of socioeconomic back-
ground on grade progression were esti-
mated using a sequence of logistic re-
sponse models (see Equation 1) which
were estimated by maximum-likelihood
procedures for individual-level observa-
tions (DuMouchel, 1976; Hanushek and
Jackson, 1977). The coefficients denote
the change in the log odds (or percentage
change in the odds) of grade progression
per unit change in an independent vari-
able.*

Table 3 reports the logistic response
model estimates. Each row reports the pa-
rameters and goodness-of-fit measure
(‘‘R?”’) for an equation.4 The columns
show the trends in socioeconomic back-
ground effects over nine five-year
cohorts. The ‘‘R’’s’’? show considerable
evidence of increasing socioeconomic-
background effects at some school tran-
sitions. For elementary completion there
is little trend in the statistic. By contrast,
for the transitions from 8th to 9th grade
and from 9th to 12th grade, the explana-
tory power of social background increases
substantially. For the transition from high
school to college, the effect of background
also rises, but not as strongly as for the
previous two transitions. Finally, at the
highest two transitions, where the effects
of background are small, the effect of
background is stable.

The changes in the several parental so-
cioeconomic effects generally follow the
same pattern. The effects of father’s and
mother’s schooling and parental income
are stable for eighth grade completion; in-
crease markedly at the second, third, and
fourth transitions; and change little at the
highest schooling levels where back-
ground effects are limited. For example, a
$1,000 difference in parental income for
cohorts born between 1907 and 1921 im-
plies an average difference of about 5% in
the odds of high school graduation, given
high school attendance. For cohorts born
5 As noted, the trends in socioeconomic effects on
grade progression are examined in detail elsewhere.
In brief, the trends in Table 3 result from the di-
minished selectivity of the educational process.
Within cohorts, socioeconomic effects on grade
progression decline from the earliest to the latest
school transitions. This reduction in socioeconomic
effects results from differential dropout rates, which
systematically reduce differences among children
from different socioeconomic levels on unmeasured
determinants of grade progression (for example,
ability, motivation, etc.). Greater homogeneity on
unmeasured factors at higher levels of schooling re-
duces the effects of observed socioeconomic vari-
ables. See Mare (1980) for fuller elaboration of this
argument. Between cohorts the impact of differential
attrition changes because the degree of attrition at
any schooling level is smaller in more recent than in
earlier cohorts. That is, in more recent cohorts,
larger fractions of each cohort remain in school at
each schooling level. Thus, in recent cohorts there is
greater heterogeneity on unmeasured variables at
each level of schooling. This greater heterogeneity
results in there being larger effects of observed so-
cioeconomic factors in recent than in earlier cohorts.
See Mare (1977; forthcoming) for fuller presentation
of this argument and empirical evidence in support of
It.
between background and grade progres-
sion offset this downward pressure,
stabilizing models of the educational at-
tainment process. There are, indeed, ap-
preciable increases in the associations
between background and grade progres-
sion, at least for some parental socioeco-
nomic indicators and at some school tran-
sitions. With the estimates of the associ-
ations between socioeconomic back-
ground and grade progression in hand, it is
possible to show directly the implications
of trends in grade progression rates and in
the effects of background on grade pro-
gression for the linear model parameters.

Regression coefficients in schooling
models are approximately weighted sums
of logistic response model parameters, the
weights being functions of the grade pro-
gression proportions (see Equation 13).
This result permits calculation of the ex-
pected change in the effects of back-
ground on highest grade of school com-
pleted using observed grade progression
rates but holding constant any associ-
ations between background and grade
progression. For the tth cohort this
hypothetical linear effect is

educational attainment.

For the effects of parental income, fa-
ther’s grades of schooling, and mother’s
grades. of schooling, estimates of linear
model parameters which (1) hold the py

(The effects of father’s occupational
status have not been plotted because their
Asit Change so little over cohorts.) The
three socioeconomic effects follow the
hypothesized patterns. Except for a few
outliers, the changes in the associations
between background and grade progres-
sion imply, in the absence of changes in
grade progression rates, substantial in-
creases in linear model effects. Con-
versely, changes in the grade progression
proportions imply, in the absence of
changes in the A,j, substantial decreases
in the linear model effects. The linear ef-
fects implied by changes in both the py
and Ag show little trend. The hypoth-
esized pattern is particularly clear for the
parental income effects where, apart from
an unusually large effect for the 1907-11
cohort, trends in the p; and Ag are clearly
offsetting. For the mother’s and father’s
schooling effects, this pattern is somewhat
less clear because the high correlations
between mother’s and father’s education
make the estimated effects unstable. To
take account of this, the A, for these two
variables were summed to approximate a
total parental educational effect. The im-
plied values of 8, are also plotted in the
graph of Father’s and Mother’s schooling
which shows a similar pattern to that for
parental income: a downward trend in f;,
implied by trends in grade progression
rates; an upward trend, implied by trends
Statistical models of educational stratifi-
cation embody assumptions about the
meaning of inequality of educational op-
portunity. This article has distinguished
two facets of educational inequality, the
univariate dispersion of formal schooling
and the multivariate association between
school attainment and socioeconomic
background characteristics. Simple dif-
ferences of proportions continuing in
school among background groups change
over cohorts primarily in response to the
average level of the proportions, rather
than in response to changes in the princi-
ples by which schooling is allocated. By
contrast, statistical models that measure
the association between school continua-
tion and social background, net of the
marginal distribution of schooling, are
sensitive to changes in the principles by
which schooling is allocated and not to
changes in the dispersion of the schooling
distribution.

Linear models of educational attain-
ment conflate the two aspects of educa-
tional inequality, because regression
coefficients depend mathematically on
both the marginal schooling distribution
and its association with social back-
ground. This article has shown logically
and empirically that the stability of the
stratification process, as represented by
linear models, results from the offsetting
influences of, on the one hand, decreased
variance in the schooling distribution that
exerts downward pressure on estimated
linear effects and, on the other hand, in-
creased associations between socioeco-
nomic background and grade progression
that tend to increase the linear effects.
The linear model, therefore, summarizes
two offsetting trends, and thereby con-
ceals important social change.

No model or measure is the best or the
correct way to represent inequality of
educational opportunity. Theories of
stratification are, typically, too imprecise
about the meaning of social mobility to

dictate one model over another. Alterna-
tive models nonetheless imply distinct
conceptions of inequality and are highly
sensitive to well-known social trends, es-
pecially trends in the level and variance of
formal schooling. Hence, conjectures
about the rigidification, loosening, or sta-
bility of the stratification system depend
upon conceptions of stratification and
statistical models assumed for measure-
ment purposes.

Similarly, with regard to determining
the degree of inequality of opportunity
and formulating policies to remedy it, no
single model or measure will suffice.
One’s model should correspond to one’s
concept of equity. The parameters of the
logistic response model measure—in a
sense—‘‘pure’’ inequality of opportunity
because they separate the distribution and
allocation of schooling, and measure the
latter explicitly. One can, nonetheless, ig-
nore this distinction and conclude that if,
say, 95% of a cohort completes a level of
schooling, the chances of completing that
level are highly equally distributed, and
social background matters very little. This
would be reflected in a small linear effect
on the probability of school completion.
By this conception, the appropriate rem-
edy for inequality of opportunity is to
raise the overall cohort proportion con-
tinuing in school. On the other hand, such
a conception ignores the degree to which
that small percentage of the cohort who
fail to complete the schooling level is
selected from the poorest families.
Moreover, it ignores the increasing degree
to which school continuation depends on
socioeconomic origins over cohorts in the
twentieth-century United States, despite
the increasing availability of schooling to
all persons.
