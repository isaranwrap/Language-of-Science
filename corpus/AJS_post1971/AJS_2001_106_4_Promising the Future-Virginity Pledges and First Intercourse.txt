Since 1993, in response to a movement sponsored by the Southern
Baptist Church, over 2.5 million adolescents have taken public “vir-
ginity” pledges, in which they promise to abstain from sex until
marriage. This paper explores the effect of those pledges on the
transition to first intercourse. Adolescents who pledge are much less
likely to have intercourse than adolescents who do not pledge. The
delay effect is substantial. On the other hand, the pledge does not
work for adolescents at all ages. Second, pledging delays intercourse
only in contexts where there are some, but not too many, pledgers.
The pledge works because it is embedded in an identity movement.
Consequently, the pledge identity is meaningful only in contexts
where it is at least partially nonnormative. Consequences of pledging
are explored for those who break their promise. Promise breakers
are less likely than others to use contraception at first intercourse.
public “virginity” pledges, in which they promise to abstain from sex until
marriage. By the standard set by most social movements, the pledge
movement has been a resounding success. Heralded in the popular press
as a movement of, for, and by adolescents, the pledge movement has
expanded to include hundreds of church, school, and college chapters. It
is associated with the development of new products and cultural symbols
(most notably in music) and is home to numerous interlocked Internet
pages where adolescents can pledge online, purchase pledge merchandise,
and interact with other pledgers in pledge-dedicated chat rooms. Pledgers
can even go to summer camps where only other pledgers can be found.
The movement has been successful in organizing mass rallies in which
speakers extol the benefits of abstinence to stadiums full of eager ado-
lescents. Its growth rate has been phenomenal, and with it, the movement
has spawned a whole new subculture in which it is “cool”to say no to sex,
and where, according to one account, “virginity is hot” (Young and Mod-
ern, May 1998, in an issue featuring the 100 secrets of Leonardo DiCaprio).

The pledge movement is really a movement organized by adults for
adolescents and so, not surprisingly, while pledging is for adolescents, the
movement is also attractive to many adults.” Movement rhetoric stresses
orientations that are loosely labeled as “family values.” Supporters of the
pledge like the idea that adolescents can take individual responsibility for
their sexual life simply by promising to say no thank you to sex—at least
until marriage. Others, on the other hand, are not as sympathetic to the
pledge movement. On one hand, pledge critics simply do not believe that
something as simple as a pledge can work. In part, they feel uncomfortable
endorsing an element of a program (in this case, the pledge) that is based
on assumptions that are antithetical to a liberal vision of the world, for
example, the assumption that sex should only occur in the context of
marriage. Critics do not necessarily oppose the idea of “saving” sex until
marriage, but they think that it is an unrealistic foundation for social

’ The pledge movement is loosely organized. More than 80 autonomous organizations
sponsor public pledges, support chapter formation, and participate in organizing rallies
of varied scale. Movement organizers claim disinterest in the number of adolescents
who have taken a pledge. They keep no formal records, and they have few formal
mechanisms in place to coordinate the efforts of participating organizations. The pledge
movement is one of the activist arms of the more general abstinence-only movement.
policy. In part, critics find themselves uncomfortable with the pledge
because many pledge supporters think that sex education sends the wrong
message to adolescents.*And critics do not like the fact that the pledge
movement rests on, and reinforces, the imagery of romantic love,’ not
because critics of the pledge are cynics, but because pledge rhetoric seems
to be associated with traditional gender roles in adolescence as well as
young adulthood.>

Whether pledge supporters or critics, most adults are concerned about
adolescent sex, here defined as intercourse.° Critics are more concerned
about the observable consequences of sex: heightened risk for teenage
pregnancy, abortion, and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and in-
creased likelihood of participation in other risk activities, such as drinking,
smoking, and substance abuse (Resnick et al. 1997; Tubman, Windle, and
Windle 1996a, 19966; AGI 1994; Martin 1996; Thompson 1995). In this
view there is nothing wrong with sex per se.’ The problem with sex is
that it has often has negative consequences, especially for girls, who typ-
ically feel worse after sex than before sex (Joyner and Udry 1998), and
who face the risk of unwanted pregnancy. Pledge supporters do not ar-
ticulate their opposition to sex in terms of the consequences of sex, because
this would appear to legitimize “good” sex. Instead, they stress moral
systems that justify saying no thank you to sex in and of itself.

To anticipate the main empirical findings reported in this article, there
might be something for everyone. Pledge supporters will find comfort in
the fact that the pledge has a substantial effect on the timing of first
intercourse. Adolescents who pledge, controlling for all of the usual char-
acteristics of adolescents and their social contexts that are associated with
the transition to sex, are much Jess likely than adolescents who do not
pledge, to have intercourse. The delay effect is substantial and robust.
Pledging delays intercourse for a long time. In this sense, the pledge
works.* Critics of the pledge should find solace from two important ca-
veats. First, the pledge effect is strongly conditioned by age. Pledging does
not work for adolescents at all ages. Second, pledging delays intercourse
only in contexts where there are some, but not too many, pledgers. Too
few, and too many, pledgers in the adolescent world can negate the pledge
effect. The pledge effect is largely contextual.’

We reach these conclusions with data from the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health (hereafter, Add Health), which was collected
at the height of the pledge movement, the period between 1994 and 1996
(Bearman, Jones, and Udry 1997). Add Health provides detailed infor-
mation on the social contexts in which adolescents are embedded. The
clustered design of Add Health allows us to investigate the effect of pledg-
ing, in the same interacting communities, on pledgers and nonpledgers
alike. The longitudinal design of Add Health allows us to order cause
and effect without ambiguity. Because our analyses operate on complex
data structures at multiple levels of observation, showing the findings we
identify involves a number of steps. These steps are outlined below.

We first briefly review the literature on sexual debut. Because the pledge
is embedded in an identity movement, we consider the specific aspects of
such movements that provide the foundation for both their success and
failure. We then describe the Add Health study and the design and meth-
ods of our analysis. We then describe the transition to first sexual inter-
course and look at differences between pledgers and others.’® Because we
restrict our analyses of pledging to adolescents for whom we can un-
ambiguously order intercourse and pledging, our sample is selective. We
discuss the impact of sample selectivity for our results in appendix A.
The impact is negligible for nonblack adolescents.

We then turn to multivariate event history models of the transition to
first intercourse. We focus on identifying main effects and observe the
strong impact of the pledge on the transition to first intercourse, controlling
for all of the relevant factors associated with pledging. As the transition
dynamics are different for adolescent females than for males, we next test
a wide range of gender interactions with a model focusing on individual-
level and partnership characteristics. Because pledge rhetoric invokes the
idiom of romantic love, we focus on the interaction between pledging,
emotional commitment within relationships, and the transition to inter-
course. The results show significant race and gender differences. Specif-
ically, whereas emotional commitment within relationships is positively
associated with the transition to sex within that relationship for most
adolescents, the opposite is true for black males. Black males are not
likely to have intercourse in relationships characterized by emotional
closeness. They are likely to have intercourse in relationships that invoke
little emotional commitment.

Next, we explore context effects on the transition to first intercourse,
specifically, the proportion of pledgers in a respondents’ school for both
pledgers and others. Here we identify the core contextual effect described
above. We also show how pledging is driven by the proportion of pledgers
in school.

We then relax one important assumption underlying the event history
models previously discussed. Specifically, we explore possible age de-
pendencies of the estimated parameter effects. Here, we ask whether the
presence and magnitude of factors affecting the transition to first inter-
course depends on the age in which their influence is exerted. We show
that most factors are critically sensitive to age. The pledge effect also
depends on an adolescent’s age.

After the detailed analysis of the effects of pledging on sexual initiation,
we look specifically at health outcomes and the health behavior of pledgers
and others who have had intercourse. It is easy to say that the pledge is
not likely to work in the long run because eventually most everyone will
transition to intercourse before marriage. But this is misguided, for even
if pledging works only to delay intercourse, and even if pledgers eventually
have sex before they marry, pledging may be a way to bridge some of
the difficult years in early adolescence without (unwanted) sexual activ-
ity.’ Still, critics have argued that promise breakers will feel guilty after
SOCIAL INFLUENCES ON ADOLESCENT SEXUAL DEBUT

Our empirical work builds from a large literature on the determinants of
first intercourse. The key insight that we exploit is the recognition that
adolescents are embedded in multiple social contexts—families, schools,
peer groups, and romantic relationships—and that these social contexts,
in interaction with individual characteristics, are important determinants
of adolescent behavior (Udry and Bearman 1998; Perry, Kelder, and
Komro 1993; Brooks-Gunn and Paikoff 1993). Our goal in this short
section is to identify the salient influences on sexual debut discussed in
previous work in order to provide the foundation for a baseline model
from which we can assess the pledge effect.

Many adolescent “problem behaviors,” like sexual activity, drinking,
smoking, are behaviors that are socially sanctioned, acceptable, and en-
joyable for many adults (Udry and Bearman 1998). While not socially
sanctioned, it is reasonable to think that they are also enjoyable for ad-
olescents. Consequently, one idea is that in the absence of social control,
all adolescents would engage in nonnormative (enjoyable) behavior.” It
follows that one determinant of sexual behavior is the extent to which
adolescents are subject to, and influenced by, social controls that operate
to constrain opportunity to engage in nonsanctioned behavior, or heighten
the costs of such behavior. Conversely, social influence (especially the
influence of partners, for sexual behavior) may operate to enhance the
perceived benefits of nonnormative behavior. Many of the social context
variables that we use in our baseline model derive from the social control
perspective. The central idea is to capture through measurement the social
influences on adolescents that shape the costs, benefits, and opportunities
for sexual initiation.

Table 1 identifies the main social (and developmental) influences on
sexual debut. Within each domain, core variables identified in prior lit-
erature and their hypothesized relationship to sexual debut that we use
in our analyses are listed. For each effect we note if it is hypothesized to
be protective (negative) or risk enhancing (positive). Many of these factors
are likely to influence sexual behavior differently across the adolescent
life course. There are also strong indications in the literature that the
transition dynamic for girls is different than that for boys. Consequently,
gender interactions across many of the variables capturing social influence
are expected. Potential gender interactions are listed in table 1. Compar-
atively little work has been done that focuses on age dependencies with
respect to adolescent transition to first sex, but such dependencies are
likely important. Physical and pubertal development, for example, is likely
to be more differentiated among younger teens (Udry and Billy 1987).
Consequently, it is reasonable to expect that the effect of physical devel-
opment on the transition to first sex is stronger for younger adolescents
than for older adolescents. Likewise, as adolescents get older, peers may
become more influential, while parents’ influence may decline as adoles-
cent autonomy increases (Hofferth 1987; Bearman and Briickner 1999).
Consequently, we would expect to observe enhanced peer influence and
declining parental influence on sexual behavior as adolescents age. For
each influence listed, we note whether or not there is an expected age
dependency.

PEER AND PARTNERSHIP INFLUENCES

Consistent with the expectations of control theory, Bearman and Briickner
(1999) show that peer influences (net of family, individual, and social
demographic factors) on the transition to first intercourse are generally
“positive”—that is, they work to delay age at first intercourse. Connections
to peers, as with connections to parents, raise the costs of engaging in
nonsanctioned behaviors. In contrast, partnership effects are generally
“negative”—that is, they hasten the transition to first intercourse. The
more frequently and the earlier adolescents date, the earlier they have
intercourse. Commitment to a romantic relationship also plays a role in
the timing of first intercourse (Furstenberg 1976; Spanier 1975). Likewise,
partner and partnership characteristics are seen to play a key role in the
timing of first intercourse. Critical in this regard are the extent to which
the partnership is embedded in larger social networks and whether it is
characterized by emotional commitment. Partnerships that draw adoles-
cents away from peers (i.e., that isolate young persons) are more likely to
be associated with sex. Except for black males, emotional commitment
within the partnership, controlling for partnership duration, is positively
associated with the transition to sex within that partnership. These part-
nership effects are thought to operate on adolescents by changing their
perception of the costs and benefits of intercourse.
INDIVIDUAL, BIOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL DEMOGRAPHIC
INFLUENCES

Independent of background and family structure, adolescents who have
reached puberty are more at risk to intercourse than those who have not."
Smarter adolescents are more likely to delay intercourse (Bearman and
Briickner 1999; Halpern et al. 2000). Cognitive skills, interests outside the
dating culture, as well as self-esteem are seen to be important delaying
factors of sexual initiation for girls. Academically inclined girls are less
interested in, and less interesting for, boys (Hayes 1987; Hofferth 1987).
In general, the more adolescents do (constraining their opportunities and
increasing their investments in socially sanctioned activities) the later they
have intercourse. Participation in extracurricular activities— both aca-
demic clubs and sport teams—delays intercourse (Bearman and Briickner
1999), as do a cluster of variables associated with attachment and com-
mitment to school (Resnick et al. 1997). These attachments draw adoles-
cents into a wider circle of peers and activities, all of which raise the costs
associated with early sexual debut. More religious adolescents tend to
engage in sexual activities later than do their less religious counterparts
(Thornton and Camburn 1989; Miller 1998; Bearman and Briickner 1999).
Behavioral measures of affiliation with one’s religion seem to be more
important than membership in specific denominations (Resnick et al. 1997;
Hayes 1987; Hofferth 1987). This suggests that it is not religious pre-
scriptions against sex per se that are salient for delaying intercourse, but
the effect of increased connectivity to others arising from participation in
church and community groups.

As noted above, these influences are likely to operate differently for
adolescents of different ages. Connections to peers and partners are ex-
pected to become more salient with age, whereas family influences are
expected to be strongest for younger adolescents. Likewise, different path-
ways to sexual intercourse for boys and girls are expected. In general,
contextual factors are thought to be more salient for girls, since the risks
associated with sexual activity are disproportionately shared by females.
Consequently, social influences that shape adolescent investments in oth-
ers—whether peers, partners, or parents—are likely to have a greater
impact on transition dynamics for girls than for boys.

Our interest in this article is in modeling the effect of taking a virginity
pledge on the transition to first intercourse by sex, age, and social context.
To be able to estimate the independent effect of a pledge, we need to
estimate baseline models for sexual debut. The influences described above,
arising in part but not exclusively from control theory, are those most
IDENTITY MOVEMENTS

The pledge is not a government program. Adolescents who pledge can
get pledge cards, but they are not required to show them to anyone.
Schools do not sponsor pledges, although they may allow pledge groups
and clubs to use their grounds before or after school. They offer no special
incentives for pledging, and pledgers are not rewarded for pledging by
schools. Pledge groups may arise from church youth groups, but they are
not isomorphic with them, and many nonpledgers and pledgers alike
belong to church groups.’® Instead, the institutional foundation of the
pledge is the local pledge group. These are only loosely coordinated with
each other though weak national leadership. The movement recruits
pledgers to local groups through the Internet, through church groups,
through Christian music and rallies, but mostly through the energies of
adults and adolescents in the community. The incentives the movement
selectively provides to its adherents are identity and fellowship with other
pledgers. The pledge identity is induced and sustained through interacting
with other pledgers in the community who distinguish themselves from
nonpledgers by their public pledge and their commitment to the group.
The pledge movement, in this sense, is an identity movement—that is, a
movement that provides a frame for self-understanding (and consequently
action in pursuit of that understanding) effective only in the context of,
and interaction with, similar others who constitute a self-conscious com-
munity differentiated from others. The key to identity movements is that
they need the other to induce the “self” (Hardin 1995; Laitin 1998; Bear-
man 1991).

Consequently, identity movements are prone to self-limiting dynamics
governing recruitment and commitment. Specifically, as a group becomes
successful, commitment to the identity declines. On one hand, the unique
Data for the analyses reported on in this article are drawn from Add
Health, a nationally representative study of American adolescents in
grades 7-12. Add Health provides data from three waves of data collec-
tion. Adolescents were included based on a multistage cluster sampling
design. Add Health is a school-based study. The primary sampling frame
was derived from the Quality Education Database, which lists all high
schools in the United States. From this list, Add Health selected a stratified
sample of 80 high schools (defined as schools with an eleventh grade and
more than 30 students) with probability proportional to size. Schools were
stratified by region, urbanicity, school type (public, private, parochial),
ethnic mix, and size. For each high school selected, Add Health identified
and recruited one of its feeder schools (typically a middle school) with
probability proportional to its student contribution to the high school,
yielding one pair of schools in 80 different communities. Schools varied
in size from fewer than 100 students to more than 3,000 students. The
Add Health sample includes private, religious, and public schools from
communities located in urban, suburban, and rural areas of the country.
The schools, and the students in them, are representative samples. Add
Health replaced schools or school pairs in each strata where a school did
not agree to participate in the survey; however, nearly 80% of the schools
that were contacted by Add Health agreed to participate in the study.

From September 1994 until April 1995, in-school questionnaires were
administered to all students in each sampled school. Each school admin-
istration occurred on a single day within one 45—60-minute class period.
Students not in school on the day of the administration did not complete
the in-school instrument. Over 80% of all students completed the ques-
tionnaire. Seven schools did not allow us to survey students in the school
but did provide us with a roster; thus we have completed in-school ques-
tionnaires from over 90,000 students attending 141 schools.'®

The in-school questionnaire provided measurement on the social and
demographic characteristics of respondents. Students were asked about
the educational and occupational background of parents, their household
structure, risk behaviors, visions of the future, self-esteem, and health
status. Students were also asked to nominate their five best male and
female friends. They reported on frequency of contacts with friends and
the sports and extracurricular activities that they participated in during
the school year. School administrators also completed a half-hour self-
administered questionnaire in the first and third years of the study.

For the second stage of data collection (the wave 1 in-home survey),
Add Health obtained rosters of all enrolled students in each school. From
the union of students on school rosters and students not on a roster who
completed an in-school questionnaire, Add Health randomly selected a
sample for a 90-minute in-home interview. Students who did not partic-
ipate in the in-school survey were eligible to be selected for participation
in the in-home main sample. Consequently, the wave 1 sample includes
students who did not participate in the in-school survey as well as students
who had dropped out of school. Add Health completed 20,745 wave 1
in-home interviews, with an 80% response rate. Parental interviews are
available for slightly more than 85% of all adolescents in the in-home
sample.

Data collected during the in-home phase of Add Health provide mea-
surement on more sensitive health risk behaviors, such as drug and alcohol
use, sexual behavior, and criminal activities in addition to detailed mea-
surement of the student’s health status, health utilization, peer networks,
decision making, family dynamics, aspirations, and attitudes. In addition,
Add Health collected detailed data on romantic partnerships, including
but not limited to the sequence of activities with partnerships and the
structure of romantic and sexual networks. The adolescent in-home in-
terview was conducted using ACASI technology for all sensitive health
status and health risk behavior questions. Adolescents listened to ques-
tions through earphones and directly entered their responses into a laptop
computer, thereby eliminating any potential for interviewer or parental
effects on their responses. ACASI technology has been shown to reduce
response bias associated with sensitive questions and nonnormative be-
havioral items (Turner et al. 1998).

The first wave of in-home interviews was initiated in May 1995 and
completed in December 1995. Most interviews were conducted during the
summer. Follow-up interviews (wave 2) with adolescents who participated
in the first wave of the in-home survey were conducted between April
and September 1996. Interviews were not attempted with wave 1 seniors
in wave 2. Over 85% of all eligible wave 1 respondents participated in
wave 2, resulting in 14,787 interviews.

The analyses reported in this article make use of data from both in-
home waves, the in-school interview, the parent interview, and school
administrator surveys. School and network information comes from the
in-school survey; all measures of adolescents’ and parents’ characteristics
and attitudes are derived from the wave 1 in-home interview and parental
questionnaire; and information on the timing of sexual initiation and
romantic involvement is taken from both waves of in-home interviews.”
Therefore, we stratify the analysis by race and test for gender interactions
within each group.’* Hispanic and Asian respondents are included with
the white sample and identified with a dummy variable. We measure SES
as a composite index of parents’ education and occupation, combining
information from in-home adolescent and parental questionnaires.

Family type is measured in three categories: adolescents living with
both biological parents (comparison category); adolescents living only with
their mother or father; and adolescents living with two adults one or both
of whom are step- or foster parents. We control for perceived parental
attitudes toward sex. To measure closeness to parents, we constructed an
index from three questions (a = .87; see app. C for exact wording).

Sexual debut is generally conditional on interest in and ability to have
sex, both of which are associated with physical maturation and puberty.
In this analysis, we make use of data on self-reported physical develop-
ment. Specifically, we use an index constructed from the mean of three
items (@ = .65). Girls were asked about breast and body development,
boys about facial and body hair growth. Both were asked whether they
looked younger, about the same, or older then adolescents in their age/
sex group.” As an indicator for psychological well-being, we use a scale
of self-esteem constructed from the 11 items reported in appendix C
(a = .86) and rated on a Likert scale. Cognitive ability is measured with
the Add Health PPVT (Peabody Picture Verbal Test; referred to hereafter
as “Add Health verbal test score”). In previous research adolescents with
greater cognitive skills have been found to delay intercourse (Hofferth
1987; Halpern et al. 2000). There is some indication that the relationship
between IQ and sex is curvilinear (Halpern et al. 2000; Bearman and
Briickner 1999). We test this hypothesis and find little support for it with
respect to either pledging or age of first sex. In addition, we control for
grade point average (GPA) as an indicator for academic orientation and
achievement.

Adolescents’ religiosity is measured with three behavioral items (a =
.85; see app. C for wording): frequency of praying, church attendance,
NETWORK, PARTNERSHIP, AND SCHOOL CONTEXT VARIABLES

A simple measure of how popular adolescents are is, in degree, the number
of nominations as friends (including romantic partners) they receive from
others in their school. Because we need data on complete social networks
to calculate in degree, this information is taken from the self-administered
in-school survey. Unpopular, socially isolated teens may be both less at-
tractive and lacking opportunity to recruit romantic partners among their
friends and friends’ friends. Since the distribution of the number of nom-
inations is highly skewed, we constructed a dummy variable indicating
unpopular teens.”

The in-home surveys contain a wealth of information about adolescents’
romantic relationships. For the 18 months before the first in-home inter-
view, Add Health provides full retrospective information on start and
end dates of relationships as well as a description of the behaviors oc-
curring in each relationship.” In order to make full use of this information
we construct four time-varying variables from the relationship questions.
A dummy variable indicating whether or not the respondent is currently
in a romantic relationship and a count of how many romantic relationships
the respondent has had (including the current relationship) serve as mea-
sures of exposure. The nature of the relationship is measured with two
indexes. Social embeddedness of the relationship is constructed from three
items asking about the occurrence of specific social events: going out
together in a group, meeting each other’s parents, and telling others about
the relationship (see app. C for the exact wording). We expect social
embeddedness to delay the onset of sexual activity in the relationship,
since embedded relationships are more visible to parents and peers and
thus more subject to social control. Emotional commitment combines the
following events: going out alone with one’s partner, seeing less of friends,
thinking about oneself as a couple, giving each other presents, and saying
“T love you” to each other (see app. A). We expect emotional commitment
to increase the likelihood for initiating intercourse (Martin 1996; Thomp-
son 1995).

One central concern of this article is how the effect of pledging is
mediated by adolescents’ social context. We subsequently show that the
effect of an individual adolescent’s pledge on his or her transition to first
intercourse depends on the prevalence of pledging in his or her school.
The effects of pledging depend on the extent to which dating relationships
are confined to the school itself. Where the social environment beyond
the school context provides ample opportunity for romantic involvement,
the school context is likely to matter less than in schools where romantic
partnerships are largely limited to the school. We therefore define socially
closed schools as schools where the overwhelming majority of adolescents’
friendships are within school. For each school, we calculated the ratio of
opposite-sex friendship and romantic ties sent to other students in the
same school over the total number of ties sent by students in the school.”
As an indicator for social closure we use a cutoff point of 83% within
school friendship and romantic partnership ties. This corresponds to the
sixty-fifth percentile of the distribution of within school ties over all ties.
In order to explore these context effects we introduce interaction effects
between pledging, proportion of female/male pledgers in the school, and
social closure.**
MODELS

We estimate a hazard rate model, modeling the duration from age at the
wave | interview to first sexual intercourse. Data for respondents who
never had sex are censored at the time of the second in-home interview.
For this kind of problem, where we have both right censoring (the event
has not yet occurred) and time varying covariates, event history methods
are appropriate.

There are reasons to assume that the transition rate will not be constant
over time even when controlling for all kinds of factors affecting the
transition to first intercourse. A flexible approach to this time dependence
of a rate is provided by a piecewise constant model with time periods
(Blossfeld and Rohwer 1995). In this model, the process time axis (age)
is divided into periods. The rate may change between periods but is
assumed to be constant within each period. Formally, the rate from the
origin state 7 to the destination state k is defined as follows:

r(t) = explay’” + ANB | if tel,

where a is a constant coefficient for the /th time period, A” is a vector
of covariates, and 6” is an associated vector of coefficients (Blossfeld and
Rohwer 1995, p. 111). The coefficients for the time periods express the
baseline rate (comparable to an intercept in a regression model), while
the covariates shift the baseline rate upward or downward.” The effect
of the covariates on the rate is assumed to be proportional over time in
this type of model. That means that the effect of the covariates in relative
terms is assumed to be constant over the course of adolescence, while the
“baseline” rate is allowed to change over time. The division of the time
axis into periods is arbitrary to some extent. The strategy we followed is
to make the periods as small as possible while assuring that there are
enough events (i.e., transitions) in each period to obtain stable and robust
estimates for the rate. An extension of this basic model, the piecewise
constant exponential model with period-specific effects, allows us to test
the proportionality assumption by estimating a time-period-specific co-
efficient for each of the independent variables in the model.

In addition to right censoring, we also have to take left truncation into
account, since we lose all respondents who already had sex by the time
of the wave 1 interview. One solution to left truncation, which is easily
implemented with the kind of model we will estimate, is to let the risk
period for each person begin at the age they were interviewed for the first
time (a detailed explanation and alternative solutions can be found in
Guo [1993]).”*

Values for the time-varying relationship covariates are introduced in
the model by means of episode splitting (Blossfeld and Rohwer 1995).
Initially, each respondent contributes one episode from birth to first sex
or interview date. When the values of time-dependent covariates change,
the episode is split into two subepisodes. The first subepisode is assigned
the start value of the covariate and is coded as right censored, while the
second subepisode is assigned the new value of the time-varying covariate
and the appropriate destination state.

* Significant difference between pledgers and others (within group) in distribution (t-test for metric variables; y’-test for dummy variables).
We turn now to the multivariate analysis of the transition to first inter-
course. The goal is to test whether the differences between pledgers and
others account for pledgers delayed sexual initiation (see app. A), or
whether there is an effect of pledging that is independent of other char-
acteristics of pledgers. A baseline model is reported in table 4. We then
test gender interaction effects across both groups (tables 5 and 6). We then
introduce the school context effect (model 2 in tables 7 and 8) and ask
whether the estimated effects are stable across time as assumed in our
basic model (tables 9 and 10). In tables 5-10 we report the results in terms
of relative risk of experiencing the transition. Coefficients that express the
effect of independent variables on the baseline transition rate in propor-
tional hazard models, are often denoted as, and calculated as, exp(8). The
number corresponding to [exp (8) — 1] x 100 provides the expected per-
centage change of the baseline rate given a one-unit change in the as-
sociated covariate, other variables being equal. For an easier interpre-
tation of the results, we report estimated exp(@) and the associated 95%
confidence interval. For variables with confidence intervals that include
1, we cannot reject the null hypothesis. For interaction effects for which
we have specific hypotheses about the direction of the effect, we use a
one-tailed significance test and report the associated 90% confidence in-
terval. The relative risk for nonblack pledgers of 0.66 reported in table
4, for example, means that for this group, the baseline rate is reduced by
34%—(0.66 — 1) x 100—for pledgers compared to others, other things
being equal.

In table 4, we report the results for the hazard model for white, Asian,
and Hispanic respondents. The time (age) axis is split into 11 periods of
six months each, except for the first and last period, which, due to the
small number of events, are longer. In this model, adolescent females are
seen to transition at the same rate as males. Hispanic respondents are not
different from whites. Asians’ risk of sexual initiation is about 33% lower
than that of whites. Adolescents living with single parents or in step- or
foster families have a higher risk of sexual debut than those living in
families with two biological parents (27% and 24%, respectively). As in
previous research, higher SES decreases the risk of sexual debut.

Closeness to parents has the expected direction, but is not significant
in this model, while perceived parental disapproval of sexual activity
decreases the relative risk by 20% for each unit change on the five-point
scale. Adolescents in romantic relationships are more than twice as likely
to experience intercourse, and exposure through previous dating relation-
ships increases risk of sexual debut by about 16% for each additional
previous romantic partner. Emotional commitment in the current rela-
tionship increases the relative risk by 14% for each unit change on the
five- point scale, while embeddedness of the relationship is not significant.
Higher school attachment and higher grades decrease the risk substan-
tially, as expected, while participation in school sports and self-esteem are
not significant. Socially unpopular adolescents are less likely to have in-
tercourse, while adolescents that are more physically mature than their
peers are more likely to have intercourse. Higher religiosity decreases the
risk of sexual debut.

Pledging decreases the risk of intercourse substantially and indepen-
dently. Pledgers’ relative risk of sexual initiation is estimated to be 34%
lower than nonpledgers, even after controlling for a wide range of personal
characteristics, religiosity, and other protective factors. This is the main
pledge effect. It is robust to model specification. And it is observed even
when the main correlates of pledging (see app. B) are in the model.” We
discuss the pledge effect further below.

Fic. 1.—Estimated effect of emotional commitment on black males (based on results
reported in table 6 below; other covariates are evaluated at means/modes).
described below in the second model reported in tables 7 and 8. We first
distinguish schools with respect to their providing the focus for adolescent
friendship and romantic relationships. For all groups, we can observe a
significant three-way interaction between pledging, social closure in the
school, and %pledgers of the same sex in the school.** We focus the dis-
cussion on the results for nonblack adolescents (table 7, model 2). The
results for blacks (table 8) are similar to those discussed below but more
difficult to ascertain since the interaction terms are significant only at the
.01 level. The effect is complex.

In socially open schools—that is, schools where less then 83% of friend-
ship and romantic ties to the opposite sex are sent within the school

the coefficient for female). For reasons of space and ease of interpretation, we report
only the estimates for the reduced model specification.

“ Introducing only interaction effect terms for pledging and percent same-sex pledgers
results in nonsignificant coefficients. The context effect of pledging thus depends on
whether social relations are largely confined within the school. This result is not sub-
stantively sensitive to the cutoff point chosen for social closure, but the estimates get
smaller when using a lower cutoff and greater when using a higher cutoff. We present
the full interactional model in tables 7 and 8, including the estimates for nonpledgers;
when restricting the model to the context effect for pledgers only, the interaction effects
yield a significant improvement of the model fit x’ = 8; df = 3; P = 0.04). Excluding
the nonsignificant parameters does not affect the estimates for the significant interaction
effect parameters.

itself—the delay effect of pledging on an individual’s transition rate de-
pends on how many other students of the same sex have pledged. Where
no other pledgers were present at the time of the first in-home interview,
pledgers transition at the same rate as others. In short, there is no delay
effect. The more other pledgers are present in the school, however, the
later pledgers initiate intercourse. Specifically, for nonblack adolescents
(table 7, model 2), for every 1% additional same-sex pledgers, the rate of
transition to first intercourse is delayed by 2%. In socially open schools,
pledging delays intercourse only if there is an interacting community of
pledgers.

We call schools where the majority of cross-sex friendship and romantic
relationship ties are sent to other students in the school “socially closed.”
For socially closed schools (30% of the schools in our sample), where social
relations are largely confined within the school, the opposite obtains.
Where no other pledgers are present, pledgers are much less likely than
others to experience sexual debut. Where many other pledgers are present
in these schools, pledgers’ transition rate is higher than that of pledgers
in schools with few pledgers. These findings are illustrated in figure 3,
which reports the estimated relative effect of %pledgers on the transition
rate for nonblack pledgers in both school types.

For adolescents in schools with more than 30% pledgers, the relative
change in the baseline rate changes from negative to positive, indicating
a threshold for pledging’s effectiveness.* Once the pledge becomes nor-
mative, it ceases to have an effect. The pledge identity is meaningful,
consequently, only if it is a minority identity, a common situation for
identity movements.” In socially open schools, all identities can be in the
minority.

The pledge movement as an identity movement and the pledge effect
as an identity effect would be consistent with an empirical observation
that the effect of pledging approaches zero with increasing proportion of
pledgers in a school. Instead, we observe a reversal of the effect, that is,
a positive effect of pledging on the hazard rate. To interpret this reversal
recall that the rate is a “temporally local” dimension.*’ Recall that the
same dynamic appears earlier in this article as well. Early gender differ-
ences and later convergence in the survivor functions for the transition
to first sex (fig. Al) necessarily translates into different estimates of the
gender effect on the baseline rate depending on which ages we look at.
When looking at a sample that includes early transitioners, females are
expected to have a lower transition rate than males. When looking at
later ages, the rate for females is higher than for males—females have to
“catch up” with males in order for the proportions to converge, as they
do in figure Al. In the same way, pledgers have to “catch up” with non-
pledgers, resulting in a transition rate that is higher than that of
nonpledgers.**

Consider by analogy two tubs of water that both have to become full
(i.e., the eventual transition to first sex). If one faucet is running at full
blast it fills up quickly. The other faucet runs more slowly, so at a certain
time it is less full than the first. But, in order for both tubs to be full at
roughly the same time, the second faucet needs to release water more
quickly at some time. This faster release of water to achieve parity is the
*° We tested for nonlinearity in the context effect by breaking up the distribution in
sets of dummy variables (e.g., 0 up to 15%, 15 up to 30%, 30% up to 40% pledgers,
above 40%). We tried out different cutoffs for the groups but there was no indication
that the effect turns around. The model fit did not increase, and the dummy variables
indicating high percentages of pledgers were significant in interaction with school type.
4° AJS reviewers also suggested we use “social closure” as a continuous variable rather
than as a dummy variable with an arbitrary cutoff point and to represent the resulting
three-way interaction between pledging, context, and school closure as a three-dimen-
sional plot. Unfortunately, the distribution of the social closure measure (proportion
of opposite-sex friendship ties within school) is not normally distributed (most teens
are in schools with very few outside ties). In addition, the use of a continuous variable
for the three-way interaction implies a linear association of social closure with the
interaction effect of pledging and proportion pledgers, an assumption that does not
hold in these data (see n. 22 above for the choice of a cutoff point). It was also suggested
to employ a “more naturally” dichotomous school characteristic such as urban or
regional characteristics as a substitute for the social closure measure. There is no one-
to-one correspondence between rural settings or location and social closure, however,
and it seemed preferable to use a concept that has direct bearing on the nature of the
underlying sociological mechanism rather than a categorical proxy that introduces
both measurement error (since there are socially open schools even in nonurban settings
and in the South, for example) and conceptual ambiguity. Although characterizations
of the environment such as urbanicity and region are associated with the outcomes
studied in this article, in the multivariate context of the analysis shown they do not
contribute to any of the models, most likely because we control for a great number of
intervening variables such as individual and family characteristics.

*' This is the closest that we can come to modeling the process. Reviewers suggested
using the estimates of the odds of pledging obtained in the logistic regression reported
in appendix B instead of the observed pledge as a covariate in the hazard models,
even though these estimates would be based on a different sample. The idea is to rule
out the possibility of correlated errors resulting from the fact that pledging in schools
where pledging is common is in part a measure of being in such a school. In other
words, the proportion of pledgers in the school would be an indicator of the extent of
“unobserved heterogeneity” among pledgers, but only in some schools and not in others.
It is a well-established finding that as a movement grows, members will be more
heterogeneous with respect to their backgrounds and orientations. For the unobserved
heterogeneity interpretation to be consistent with the reported results, however, social
closure has to be interpreted as an indicator for heterogeneity of pledgers (albeit only
when many pledgers are around). Hence, we also need to find some property of the
school that accounts for both widespread pledging of heterogeneous students and a
tendency for friendship ties to be organized within the school. We have tried to rule
out the presence of any such property we could think of in terms of characteristics of
students, parents, and schools. For example, small schools may have both more het-
erogeneous students (in spite of residential segregation) and be socially closed. Con-
versely, large schools may have a more heterogeneous but larger student body and
thus could have a critical mass of homogenous pledgers and be socially open. However,
socially closed schools are on the average slightly bigger than socially open schools.
In addition, the school type-context interaction effect cannot be reproduced/erased
with a school size-context interaction effect. But beyond this, the proposed strategy
cannot work for our analyses. The reason why we used observed rather than predicted
pledging in the sexual debut models is a time-ordering issue. Recall that the strongest
predictors of pledging are characteristics that vary over time (being in a romantic
relationship, number of partners, and, most important, proportion of pledgers in the
school). Because we have no information on the timing of pledges, we cannot use these
predictors for estimating the odds of pledging for adolescents in the sample used for
predicting the timing of sexual debut because we do not know their values. Imagine
further if one would use the current values (e.g., romantic involvement, proportion of
pledgers) of the determinants of pledging to calculate the predicted log odds of pledging
for our debut models. Since all the variables predicting intercourse are also in the
pledge prediction equation, by definition one throws away the unique contribution
pledging makes because the predicted score would consist only of the contribution the
other covariates make to pledging. Since we control for all of these in the sexual debut
model, the predicted odds of pledging should not have an effect by definition. Unob-
served heterogeneity of pledgers, in a way, is exactly what makes them pledgers and
different from others. Of course, in the debut models, this is not technically unobserved
since we measure it as pledge. But it is unobserved in the pledge model—it is exactly
the part we would throw away if we used the predicted odds. This would not be the
case if we had measures of the predictors of pledging before pledging occurs. But our
data do not allow us to do this.

The models presented so far assume the effects of explanatory variables
to be constant over time. There are reasons to assume, however, that some
factors are more important early on in the process while others figure
more prominently later on.

We are especially interested in the effectiveness of the pledge across the
course of adolescence. In the following analyses, reported in table 9 and
10, we therefore relax the proportionality assumption and estimate a
model in which the effect of all the independent variables is allowed to
vary across time periods. This involves estimating a great number of
parameters. To ensure that there are enough events and variation in the
independent variables for each time period, we divide the observed age
axis into three time periods, which roughly correspond to early (12.5 years
to 15.5 years), middle (15.5 years to 17.5 years), and late adolescence (17.5
and older). For black adolescents, we choose slightly different age periods
that reflect the earlier onset of puberty and sexual behavior. The results
are reported in table 9 for nonblacks and table 10 for blacks. The results
for blacks are based on a rather small number of events and should be
interpreted with care.

The direct gender effect increases with age as girls catch up with boys.
Hispanic adolescents differ from whites mainly in middle and later ad-
olescence, Asians in middle adolescence (table 9). Our expectation was
that parents’ influence on the behavior of teens would be greatest in early
adolescence and decline later as their children achieve more independence
and autonomy. For nonblack adolescents, this hypothesis is borne out.
Closeness to parents has a significant effect only in early adolescence.
Recall that it was not significant in the simpler model reported in table
7. With respect to family type, the results are less conclusive although
there is a tendency for the effect size to be stronger in early and middle
adolescence. For girls only, parents’ SES has significant effects only in
late adolescence. Perceived parental disapproval of sex, however, is a
strongly delaying factor throughout adolescence (table 9). The time-
variant influence of family type is more pronounced for black adolescents
(table 10). The coefficients for closeness to parents and parental disap-

for late adolescence), and not significant. As expected, pubertal devel-
opment is most important for young adolescents; each one-unit change
in the five-point scale is estimated to increase the transition rate by 41%,
other things equal, while for young black males, it is almost twice as large
(83%). As in the simpler proportional hazard model reported in tables 7
and 8, cognitive ability is not related to the timing of first intercourse for
nonblacks (but it does delay intercourse for older blacks). Both academic
achievement and sports participation (for nonblack girls only) have the
strongest delay effect in early and middle adolescence. The gendered pat-
tern of self-esteem’s influence for nonblacks is pronounced only in late
adolescence, when girls with high self-esteem are actually less likely to
experience sexual debut than are girls with low self-esteem. This negative
effect of self-esteem for girls is consistent with the idea that girls with a
developed sense of self find it easier to refuse sex when negotiating ro-
mantic behavior with their male partners (Martin 1996). The change of
the effect over time and the gender interaction account for the fact that
many studies do not find any effect of self-esteem on sexual initiation
(Hofferth 1987; Brown and Theobald 1999). Religious adolescents are
slower to experience first intercourse only in middle and late adolescence
PROMISE KEEPERS AND PROMISE BREAKERS

Critics of the pledge movement suggest that pledgers who break their
promise and experience sexual intercourse will suffer negative psycho-
logical consequences. To assess this criticism, we consider two scales that
measure psychological well-being, the self-esteem scale used in the tran-
sition models above, and an 11-item depression scale. For all groups except
black males, teens who had first intercourse experience a loss of self-
esteem compared to those who remained virgins (results not shown; tables
available from the authors). Female pledgers experience an increase in
self-esteem between waves, and the interaction effect between pledging
and having intercourse is not significant for any group. We found no
indication that changes in self-esteem associated with intercourse depend
on the timing of intercourse or on age at the time of the first wave in-
terview. Hence, pledgers do not lose more self-esteem when they break
their promises than is experienced by nonpledgers who have first inter-
course. The same obtains when using the depression scale, and in a mul-
tivariate model controlling for relationship with parents, religiosity, school
integration, academic orientation, network position, and romantic in-
volvement. Thus, pledging has no negative consequences in terms of psy-
chological well-being, even for teenagers who break their promise.

We do find, however, an effect of pledging on the likelihood of using
contraception at first intercourse. In this analysis, reported in table 11,
we look only at teens who had first intercourse between waves. We use
a set of predictors similar to that used in our model of first intercourse.**

Many adults are concerned about adolescent sex, and many adolescents
are concerned as well. Many adults worry about the negative conse-
quences arising from early transitions to sexual behavior. They seek ways
to help adolescents negotiate the complex and contradictory messages they
get about sex. The pledge movement is organized by adults for adolescents.
It is designed to help adolescents say no thank you to sex. In general, if
adolescents do say no thank you, they are better off. They have fewer
health risks, and they feel better about themselves. Programs that work
to delay first intercourse make a contribution to adolescent health. Even
if we did otherwise, and even if some adolescents feel that they ought to
do otherwise, they are better off waiting. This is especially true for girls,
who are better able to negotiate better (safer) sex the older they are.

Pledgers come from normative backgrounds. They pledge because they
do not want to have sex. They do not need to pledge to avoid sex, but
pledging helps them not have sex. On the average, it reduces the baseline
rate of time to sexual debut by 34%. A pledger with four romantic partners
has the same relative risk of sexual debut as a comparable nonpledger
with no romantic partners. The pledge effect is not a selection effect. It
is real and it is substantial. But it is not a panacea for all of our adolescents.
It works best for younger adolescents. It works only in specific contexts.
The limits of the pledge’s effectiveness provide insight into the mecha-
nisms by which it operates.

The key mechanism is that pledging creates a moral community. Pledg-
ers participate in this community and take on a pledge identity. Their
joint participation sustains this identity and makes it meaningful for their
behavior. Movement organizers are well aware that their movement will
be successful if it builds a new identity. Pledge paraphernalia available
on the Internet provides visible markers of identity, pledge rings, pledge
music, pledge books. Pledgers need to be visible to others. This is because
pledging outside a community of pledgers provides no protection for ad-
olescents. Pledgers may pledge, but they cannot determine the effect of
the pledge all by themselves.

The importance of pledging for the pledge movement itself is significant.
As reported in appendix B, the effect of other pledgers among same sex
adolescents in each school on pledging is curvilinear. Up to a threshold
of around 40% pledgers, all other covariates of pledging considered at
their means and modes, the probability of pledging increases by 1% for
every additional 1% same-sex pledger in an adolescent’s school. At higher
levels of pledgers, the curve flattens out and the effect turns negative.
This relationship is illustrated in figure 4.

Pledging thus provides fuel for its own growth and success, up to a
limit. This phenomenon of self-sustained growth, with an associated
threshold, is common to identity movements. For an identity to be mean-
ingful—that is, to have a meaningful relationship to behavior—it must
be embedded in and sustained by an interacting population of persons.
Public pledge events work to encode pledging into a moral community.
The community is effective only if it has self-conscious recognition, which
presumes minority status.

The contextual effects we identify point to the mechanisms through
which the pledge effect operates. When the pledge works, it works because
pledgers are embedded in an identity movement. Like other movement
identities, the pledge identity is relatively fragile and meaningful only in
contexts where it is at least partially nonnormative. If most adolescents
were to pledge, there would be no pledge effect on the transition to
intercourse.
Not surprisingly, as with most social movements, the pledge movement
has contradictory elements. Pledge rhetoric stresses making your own
decision and getting away from the crowd. But the movement produces
as a by-product of its core activity (public pledging) something even better
than a crowd—specifically, a visible moral community. Because pledging
generates a public moral community, pledging also provides, consequently,
both a cognitive foundation for new identity (someone who has made a
commitment) and the structural context (a community of interacting
pledgers) in which identity can be articulated and practiced. The moral
community of pledging is the key to its success and failure.

Critics of the pledge movement are as concerned about adolescent sex
as are the supporters of the movement. These critics are both wrong and
right about the pledge. They are wrong when they think it does not work.
But they are right when they think that it cannot work as a universal
strategy. Of course, pledging will not work for adolescents who want to
have sex. That is always true. But pledging does not work in some social
contexts even for pledgers who do not want to have sex. If pledgers attend
a school that is the focal point of their social relationships, and if too
many other students in their school pledge, the pledge effect disappears.
In these contexts, about one-third of schools in the Add Health sample,
pledgers transition to first sex at the same rate as nonpledgers. Beyond
this, if pledgers do have sex, they are less likely to be contraceptively
prepared than nonpledgers.
APPENDIX A

Sample Selectivity

As part of the ACASI section of the in-home interviews, adolescents were
asked whether they had ever had sexual intercourse. Those who reported
intercourse were asked when they had intercourse for the very first time
(year and month). Figure Al shows the survivor function for the transition
to first intercourse, combining data from both waves,” for the full sample,
by gender and race (all adolescents with valid data on month and year).
In contrast to earlier research, among nonblacks we find gender differ-
ences only at early ages. Later, girls “catch up” and the two functions
converge.” For blacks, gender differences are pronounced until late ad-
olescence, when the survivor functions for girls and boys converge. The
median transition age for nonblack teenagers is slightly below 18 years,
for blacks, slightly over 16. These figures are comparable to other national
estimates (AGI 1994; Moore, Driscoll, and Lindberg 1998).

The great advantage of longitudinal data resides in the possibility to
order presumed causes and effects in time. Since most of our explanatory
factors, including whether adolescents had taken a pledge, are measured
in the first in-home interview, causal inferences for adolescents who by
that time already had experienced first sexual intercourse are limited.
Excluding these adolescents from the sample means that our sample is
selective for later transitions to first intercourse. We now explore the
impact of this selectivity. In our analyses, we consider only adolescents
who were virgins at their first in-home interview.** Forty-four percent of
teens in the in-home sample had already experienced sexual debut by the
time they were interviewed. Although the internal validity of causal in-
ferences is strengthened by concentrating the analysis on adolescents who
were still at risk for initiating sexual activity when data on explanatory
variables were collected, we have to be concerned with the external va-
lidity of the resulting restricted sample. Specifically, the effects of factors
influencing the age of sexual initiation can be underestimated in a sample
from which part of the population at risk has already dropped out. Figure
A2 shows a comparison between the full Add Health sample and the
restricted sample that we described above.

For nonblack respondents, who on average are older at sexual initiation,
the survivor functions for the full and restricted samples are identical
until age 15, after which they diverge somewhat. At the end of the ob-
servation period, the estimated proportion with intercourse is very similar.
For black adolescents, the restricted sample is far more selective toward
late transitions. The estimated median transition age from the restricted
sample is almost one year higher than that estimated from the full sample
for black adolescents.

In the intercourse models, adolescent pledge status is the key indepen-
dent variable we focus on. Adolescents who were not married at the time
of the first in-home interview were asked whether they had “ever taken
a public or written pledge to remain a virgin until marriage.” For nonblack
females, pledgers transitioned to first intercourse on average more than
three years later than nonpledgers (38 months). Because less than half of
nonblack male pledgers had experienced sexual initiation, we compare
the transition for pledgers and nonpledgers in the lowest quartile. Here,
pledgers transitioned to first intercourse on average 2.5 years later than
their nonpledging counterparts. For both black females and males, the
difference in median transition age between pledgers and others is slightly
above two years (27 months). For all groups, we observe a substantial
delay in sexual debut for pledgers.

For the restricted sample, selected on late intercourse, the difference in
median age for nonblack girls is still at 1.25 years. For nonblack males,
pledgers transition to first sex 20 months later than nonpledgers. For both
male and female blacks, there is no difference in median transition age
between pledgers and others. Compared to the full sample, pledgers are
overrepresented in this sample, especially among black girls. Pledgers
make up 30% of the black female restricted sample compared to 19% of
the full sample (for black boys, the respective numbers are 9% vs. 17%,
for nonblack boys 9% vs. 17%, and nonblack females 16% vs. 23%).
Thus, with our restricted sample for black adolescents we cannot show
a pledge effect - however, pledging is associated with being in our sample
(since pledgers have intercourse later, their chances to be part of our
sample are greater).
Sample selectivity also results from missing data. Like all surveys, Add
Health data suffers from missing data. Throughout, we have replaced
missing values with the means for the associated race/sex group. In all
cases we control for measurement error that may be introduced by mean
imputation. None of the dummy variables were significant in the models
reported below.”” Unfortunately, mean substitution was not always pos-
sible. A key requirement for our models involved timing relationships
with respect to intercourse. We therefore excluded all respondents who
had missing data either on the occurrence or date of first intercourse or
on starling and ending times of romantic relationships. In addition, we
lost a few respondents who had either missing data on the pledge question,
or were not linked to any of the schools in the sample. Of the 8,150
respondents who were still under risk to experience first intercourse at
the time of the first in-school interview and participated in the second,
we were able to retain 6,776 cases in the event history models reported
below. Most of these losses are due to missing start and end dates in the
relationship data. We found no indication that respondents with missing
dates were different from others in terms of their transition behavior or
in terms of the distribution of independent variables used in this analysis.
The results of these analyses are available from the authors.

Problems of selectivity are certainly present for black adolescents in
our sample. For blacks, selectivity on the dependent variable all but wipes
out the effect of our key independent variable, pledging. Given these
problems, we cannot draw inferences about race differences from our
sample. Rather, we focus on gender differences among black teenagers,
asking the reader to keep in mind that the results presented below for
black adolescents should not be taken to be representative for the pop-
ulation. For white adolescents, a delay of sexual debut associated with
pledging observed in the full sample is somewhat reduced but still sub-
stantial.*° In sum, we are more likely to under- rather than overestimate
a delaying effect of pledging on sexual debut.
APPENDIX B
Who Pledges?

In this section, we present a multivariate model of pledging with the goal
of further exploring what differentiates pledgers from others. Because the
differences we observe might be due to selection, we model the probability
of pledging between the two waves of in-home interviews. This neces-
sitates the use of a different sample than the sample we use in our tran-
sition models. First, we need to exclude all adolescents who said they had
taken a pledge in the first wave. Adolescents who had already experienced
sexual initiation at Wave 1 are excluded from the present analysis as well
since adolescents who have had sex are very unlikely to pledge. This
yields a sample of 6,849 persons, of which 699 (9.41%) report that they
have taken a pledge between waves.*' Compared to the wave 1 pledgers
included in subsequent analyses of sexual debut, the pledgers in this sam-
ple have joined the pledge movement later in its history.

We estimate a logistic regression model with the same covariates we
use in the transition rate models, including age as an additional covariate.”
Relationship information cannot be treated as time-varying covariate in
this type of model. We therefore include the relationship status as mea-
sured at the time of the first in-home interview, the number of partners
an adolescent had up to that date, and the mean characteristics of those
relationships. The results are reported in table B1.**

While pledgers are more likely to be female once we control for other
factors, the gender effect disappears. All variables associated with parents
and family background have virtually no effect on pledging. Although
we find a bivariate difference with respect to parental disapproval of
sexual initiation and parental closeness, these differences disappear in the
multivariate model, when controlling for religiosity and school context.
School integration, as well as academic achievement and sports partici-
pation are also not associated with a greater propensity to pledge. Pubertal
development and cognitive ability, however, both decrease the likelihood
