      "during the long struggles for liberty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Monopolies, as being opposed to the natural freedom of\n",
      "Englishmen, have been held to be contrary to the famous clauses\n",

      "in setting aside the royal prerogative by the Revolution of 1688.\n",
      "The bill of rights contained no express declaration against\n",
      "monopolies; but it was made impossible for the king to grant them,\n",

      "thus again made operative.\n",
      "\n",
      "The English bill of rights was the model for the sections of\n",
      "American constitutions bearing the same title. The gist of these\n",
      "declarations was that the people had a right to security in their\n",
      "persons, property, and privileges. All else was but elaboration of\n",
      "this. In some form or other declarations of rights were made\n",
      "by all the colonies long before the Revolution, some even pre-\n",

      "monopolized, or because favors had been granted to individuals\n",
      "under the proprietary governments, and it was feared they might\n",

      "that which the commons so vigorously opposed in the times of\n",

      "\n",
      "In spite of this difference, the old opposition, perpetuated in\n",

      "influence in shaping the popular hostility to the modern monop-\n",
      "oly. This influence has been most powerful in the political\n",

      "not be tolerated, both because the few are supposed to get undue\n",
      "advantage of the many, and because of the ability of powerful\n",

      "The doctrine of aissez faire has probably been more completely\n",
      "engrafted upon the political and industrial institutions of this\n",
      "country, and more thoroughly absorbed into the consciousness\n",
      "of the people, than anywhere else in the world. The individ-\n",
      "ualistic theories in philosophy, politics, and economics were most\n",
      "widely accepted at the time the colonies achieved their inde-\n",

      "The doctrines of the French philosophers were especially\n",
      "influential. It is not to be expected, however, that the early con-\n",
      "stitutions and statutes will show any effort to prevent commer-\n",
      "cial combinations and restrictions of competition. The country\n",
      "was largely agricultural, and the vast unoccupied territory ren-\n",
      "dered impossible monopolies in that branch of industry which\n",
      "was generally pursued. Moreover, when manufactures began\n",
      "to develop, the more rapid development of the country and\n",
      "its growth in population made it impossible for the evils of\n",
      "competition to bear heavily upon any industry. This condition\n",
      "of affairs continued until the close of the Civil War. No\n",
      "attempts were made to restrict monopolies, because monopolies\n",
      "did not exist; and since constant progress was seen to be pos-\n",

REPRESENTATIVES of two very respectable classes of the com-  unity are apt to find themselves in hostile attitudes in the dis-  cushion of contemporary social questions -the scientific student  of social phenomena and the \"captain of industry.\" Has the  student of sociology a right to discuss the central theme of his  field of research? This is the matter in dispute. Professor\\n Laughing (Mill, Political Economy, p. 523) says: \"The laborer,  if he would become something more than a receiver of wages,  in the ordinary sense, must move himself up in the scale of  laborers until he reaches the skill and power also to command\\n manager\\'s wages ... . It leads directly to the means by which\\n the lower classes may raise themselves to a higher position-  the actual details of which, of course, are difficult, but, as they\\n are not included in political economy, they must be left to  sociology-and forms the essential basis of hope for any proper  extension of productive cooperation.\" This definition of the  limits of economics and of the duty of sociology, made by a  master, we accept; but find ourselves absolutely opposed at the  very point where our discussion begins to have a real living  human interest. What is urged against our discipline and our  method?  It would be strange if the \"Captain of industry\" did not  sometimes manifest a militant spirit, for he has risen from the  ranks largely because he was a better fighter than most of us.  385  C    386 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL Of SOCIOLOGY.  Competitive commercial life is not a flowers bed of ease, but  a battle field where the \"Struggle for existence \" is defining the  industrial \"fastest to survive.\"  In this country the great prizes are not found in Congress, in  literature, in law, in medicine, but in industry. The successful  man is praised and honored for his success. The social reward  of business prosperity, in power praise and luxury, are so great  as to entice men of the highest intellectual faculties. Men of  splendid abilities find in the career of a manufacturer or mer-  chant an opportunity for the most intense energy. The very  perils of the situation have a fascination for adventurous and  inventive spirits. In this fierce though voiceless contest a peru-  liar type of manhood is developed, characterized by vitality,  energy, concentration, skill in combining numerous forces for an  end, and great foresight into the consequences of social events.  If the character is further analyzed we discover, along with some  apparent heedlessness of pain and many compromises with con-  science, an integrity about contracts which makes it possible to  build the business of the world on credit. Those who live in  retirement and simplicity are apt to find the swift, brusque,  imperious and impatient manners of the successful man some-  what severe and offensive dictatorial. But the ceremonial  seriousness of the parlor would be out of place in the office of  one who must think rapidly enough to keep thousands of tele-  graph operators, stenographers, clerks and other employees in  occupation. Daily speech and elaborate politeness under the  conditions of life in a great commercial house would have all the  effects of crime.  By extending this study of the psychic processes of typical  business men we might be enabled to regard some social phe-  nomen in a new and stronger light. Great business men, like  some distinguished generals, let their deeds speak for them,  They say, with some touch of contemptuous sarcasm and cani-  cis, they can hire tankers and buy books. So that to interpret  their inner life we must seize the rare occasions when they ven-  true upon speech. As the number of college men among mer-  C    BUSINESS EN AND SOCIAL THEORISTS. 387  chants increases, the points of contact with academic men are  likely to increase.  A few typical quotations may be taken as indicating the  internal mental movements of representative business men.  A very common conviction of employers is expressed clearly  and bluntly in the words of an able and upright manufacturer,  recently deceased. \"The relation between capital and labor is  one of the many questions in the comprehensive science of  political economy, and as such is a purely business matter. Phil-  anthony has nothing to do with it, nor has religion or sentiment,  any more than they have to do with astronomy or with the law  of gravitation ... . The essays of the humanitarian and the  sermons of the preacher, however soundly based on the moral-  ties and the ought-to-be, generally only confuse and obscure the  real issues. However it may be in some ideal heaven, it is the  fact that in this world it is not from motives of generosity or  philanthropy that the master hires labor, and the laborer seeks  service. And the sooner the whole matter is taken out of the  realm of sentimental philosophy and placed on the bed rock of  simple, practical business common sense the better.\" He then  proceeds to give an exposition of the determining factors in the  settlement of the rate of wages; attacks all schemes of cooper-  tion and profit-sharing as \"moonshine;\" asserts that strikes  cannot raise the real wages of labor; that increase comes from  improvements in machinery and business methods; that laborers  can secure higher income only by becoming more useful; that  the only function of the state is to prevent violence. \"All that  legislators and editors and preachers and philanthropists can do  is to educate the people that they may be able finally . . . . to  pass out of these turbulent obscuring lists of ignorant and sel-  fish struggle into the clear light of universal law and justice.\"  In this concluding sentence the cultivated, generous, success-  ful Christian business man opens a wider door than his opening  sentences promised; and it is a pleasure to add that his life was  better than his inherited economic creed.  In a speech at St. Louis before the assembled representatives  C    388 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL Of SOCIOLOGY.  of the great commercial clubs of the country Mr. William Whit-  man, of Boston, voiced a certain feeling of his peers. Mr. C. D.  Wright had suggested that in the future employers would be  held responsible before the law and at the bar of public opinion  for strikes; and that it would be held to be the duty of  employers during prosperous times to set aside a fund for the  payment of wages in times of adversity. Mr. Whitman declared  both propositions to be monstrous, and asked of the gentlemen  present: \"What do you think of them? Will they increase or  diminish your burdens ? Can you successfully prosecute your  business under them ? Do you think that this new philanthropy-  ethics-economic management will attract -the investment of  capital ?\"  The particular propositions of Mr. Wright may be dropped  out of this discussion. They are of interest here only because  they drew the fire and showed the attitude of a typical business  man toward theoretical students of society. Indeed the speaker  himself turns from propositions to personalities. \"Who are the  men engaged in promulgating these so-called reforms, ostensibly  for the benefit of workingmen ? Are they not for the most part  theorists with unbalanced minds, who have adopted unbound  principles and are pushing them to the extreme? Are they  not men without the knowledge and experience necessary to  deal successfully with men or affairs? Why should men of  affairs permit them, undisputed, unanswered, unchallenged, to  arrogant to themselves the right to teach the world how we shall  conduct our business ?\"  This speaker gives his reason for thinking that business  men carry in their own booms and interests the guarantees of  social welfare: \"The purposes of business, the sense of respond-  ability to others, the danger of personal loss and possible fail-  ure, and the hope of reward are the sure guarantees for the  conduct of affairs in the mutual interests of employer and  employed.\"  It must be admitted that this rigorous protest against  pertinent and ignorant intrusion of dilettanti upon the pre-  C    BUSINESS EN AND SOCIAL THEORISTS. 389  serves of capitalist managers is not without justification. Social  theorists need to be meek men, and should stand with head  uncovered before the special gifts and services of the men of  genius who are working the latter-day miracles of industry and  commerce. Confessions of trespass on forbidden ground are in  order, but these first be personal and curricular before any  authority prepared to shrine.  It has been said that the laws of economics should be stated  in the indicative and not in the imperative mode, and this is  true of all purely scientific theory. The only person who can  possibly decide in practical affairs is the responsible manager of  the affairs concerned. When sincere fanatics vent their ratings  under the titles of \" sociological science,\" it is not to be wondered  at that suspicion should extend to those who are really trying  to \"mount to the summit round by round.\" Orator with more  heat than light are apt to be unfounded with patient students  of practicable reform.  And yet we are not ready to confess that the student of  society is absolutely without a function, a mere useless parasite,  or at best a photographic reporter of the dead -past. Mr.  Lyman J. Gage, intimate friend of the seer, Professor Swing,  said: \"To chris false ideas concerning the motives of men  who are sailing with us in the same ship of national destiny is to  be raw and provincial. We are of the same blood, indissolubly  united in our diversified interests. v . . . By a clearer under-  standing of our mutual duties will we labor less for what we con-  side our respective rights.\" Mr. Gage would not browbeat into  silence men who are intent studying the same phenomena  which occupy business men, only from a different point of view.  It is the duty of the scholar to place and keep before the  public the supreme criterion of social conduct, the common wel-  fare. In a boiler factory, where the din and noise drown all  sounds, the cry of a child cannot be heard. So men of affairs  are apt to be defined, by the uproar of those very affairs, to the  neglected and forgotten members of our common humanity. A  table of statistics, interpreted and illustrated by literary skill,  C    390 THE AMERICAN IOURNAL Of SOCIOLOGY  may induce business men to enlarge the scope of their life  plans. The scholar\\'s duty is to aid in forming a judicial public  opinion, as distinguished from the public opinion of a class and  its special leaders.  It is the duty of the scholar, if he is a living member of con-  temporary society and something beside an archaeologist, to  secure a public recognition of all the elements of welfare. Such  a scholar will give due place to what Carlyle calls the \"prelim-  navy item,\" bread, but he will help his fellows to see and realize  that \"man cannot live by bread alone.\" For this purpose is the  scholar supported by society, in order that he may be its mentor  and seer. It is true the idealism does not see intuitively how far or  by what means these higher factors of good may be secured, but  he can remind men by his own life and works that wealth is only  a preliminary item, a means but not an end of life. And if a  business man deserves the title of captain or king he will apple-  cite the social service which reminds him of the real dignity of  his office.  It is the function and the duty of the social theorist to keep  attractive before \"practical men\" all the known and tried  methods of obtaining the elements of human well-being. In  performing this social duty the literary worker is not shut up to  the meager resources of his own invention. If his suggestions  of method are laughed out of court as the visionary schemes of  a clustered fanatic, his defense lies in a mosaic description of  facts. When his plan of amelioration is pronounced impossible,  he can bring to bear the resources of his knowledge of social  experimentation. If inhuman greed, or routine habit, or vested  interests oppose his suggestions on the ground that they are  chimerical and millennial, he can set ingenious philanthropy over  against obstructive atrice. And it is his social function as a  scholar to make the great world act upon the mean world. It is  only in such service that he can earn \\'his salt.  It is not the function of the scholar to bury the dead past, nor  to paint the future in pessimistic charcoal or optimistic permit-  ion, for the entertainment of the public. He is called to select  C    BUSINESS EN AND SOCIAL THEORISTS. 391  the facts which will help generous and denial industrial leaders  to promote the common welfare, and especially the welfare of  those who are employed by them, and over whom their com-  landing position as leaders has given great power.  It is perfectly legitimate for the scholar to collect and use  the testimony of great captains of industry to correct the sup-  ported assertions of other captains of industry. For example, in  respect to the usefulness of trades unions, Mr. Der quotes the  language of an employer: \"As an employer in one of the great  staple trades, I have always held that we owe much of our pros-  purity in the manufacturing industries to trade combinations.\"  This citation of an individual judgment is followed by a clear  summary of the actual achievements of the unions: the friendly  and material help in hard times; the care of the sick; the agencies  of education; the regulation of prices and production. \"The  humidity and selfishness of some would have made it difficult even  for just and generous employers to do right.\"\\'  In arranging the programme for the \"Congress of Industrial  Reconciliation and Arbitration \" it was difficult to secure the par-  anticipation of employers. The responses to the Civic Federation  indicated a profound skepticism in the United States as to the  value of such methods. And yet men of affairs and experience  were found who were willing to look for better methods of decide.  ing disputes. Here again Mr. Lyman J. Gage, surely no visionary,  said: \"In the business world of today, questions involving thou-  sands, nay, millions, are thus quietly and peacefully composed.  Cannot methods so benign in their character, so healthful in their  influences, find a place in the industrial relationships which now  so intimately enter into the warp and roof of our modern life.\"  In the same Congress Mr. William H. Wayward spoke for the  National Association of Builders, and claimed that he represented  an industry which \"comprehend an interest as large in amount  as that of any other single industry.\" He denied that his also-  citation was working for philanthropic ends, and yet contended  that they were serving the public. So far from trusting merely  I The Evolution of Industry, pp. i o-i I I.  C    392 THE A MERICA JOURNAL Of SOCIOLOGY.  competitive forces and the will of employers alone he reasoned  that special organization of laborers and managers is necessary.  \"It is essential to have organizations of employers, who together  shall control and direct the general principles and policies govern-  ing the common interest, so that there may be no overarching  by selfish and reckless individuals on either side.\" He accounts  for the fact that many employers have refused to accept the  plan by saying: \"The proverbial shownews of employers to know  a good thing when they see it and their proneness to let matters  drift until they get almost hopelessly entangled, in preference to  taking a little trouble in advance,\" is a sufficient explanation.  There are always business men who are not only spacious  managers, with a gift for amassing riches, but who are broad  enough to go to the margin of ability in making experiments.  The names of Robert Owen, Godin of Guise, Declare of Paris,  Parody of London and America, belong in this brilliant com-  any. Every city furnished examples of the same class and in  increasing numbers.  Mr. 0. D. Ashley in \" Railways and their Employees \" is one of  those who recognize the responsibility of employers to the  public. \"If there is social unrest in the civilized world, a fact  which will be hardly disputed, we are bound, not only as Christians  but as parts of the human brotherhood, to give careful examination  to all plans which contemplate man\\'s improvement and elevation.\"  We may discover in the very arguments by which the gentle-  men of affairs warn ethical theorists out of the manufacture a  need of theorists. It is assumed by both gentlemen quoted in  the beginning, that the class motives of employers and the laws  of nature are the sufficient guarantee of social welfare. From this  assumption of premises it follows that all discussion or intrusion  from other members of society must be pertinent and vicious.  But the state of mind disclosed in the quotations is itself a social  defect. It is symptomatic of the social temper. These quo-  stations prove that many essential elements are ignored by very  able and upright men. They imply that there is at least one  class of the community who have no interest in the issue of social  C    BUSINESS EN AND SOCIAL THEORVISTS. 393  strikes, and no right to be heard on their own behalf. They imply  that economic forces are automatic, natural and not human and  ethical. The influences which fix the rate of wages are treated  as if they belonged to the same category as the law of gravity-  tion. Human intelligence, will and aspiration are excluded from  consideration by such logic. Economics is put on the same level  as biology, or even chemistry.  The corrective of this attitude of some practical men is not  abuse but facts, just such facts as the studies of social history  supply in abundance. It is the duty and function of the theorist  to confront this automatic and fatalistic class theory of business  with the history of factory legislation. There are few facts so  pathetic as the opposition of John Bright, the pious manufacturer,  to the movement by which ethical sentiment redeemed the labor-  ing population of England from utter degradation.  It is the duty of the ethical theorist to show that the self-  interest of the manufacturer and landlord do not secure the pub-  lic welfare in any city of this country, and that it is precisely this  self-interest, narrowly conceived, which prevents rational legis-  nation against child-labor and sweat shops in Illinois. To show  these phenomena, their causes and wide results is precisely the  duty of the social scholar. \"Philanthropy has nothing to do  with it . . . any more than with astronomy or with the law of  gravitation.\" \"The purposes of business, the sense of respond-  ability to others, the danger of personal loss and possible failure,  and the hope of reward are the sure guarantees for the conduct  of affairs in the mutual interests of employed and employed.\"  Compare with these assertions the evidence presented before the  Poor Law Commissioners of England in I834 and succeeding  years; the black list of alterations of food so familiar as to  hardly excite comment; the pictures of degradation of laborers,  the crippling of children, the demoralization of women due to  unregulated \"free\" competition, which are added by Professor  Walker in his work on \"Wages,\" and by Professor H. C. Adams  in his essay on \"Relation of the State to Industrial Action.\"  Con the \"Hull House\" Maps for Chicago facts; and then say  C    394 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL Of SOCIOLOGY.  whether there is no need of \" philanthropy \" in the regulation of  industry. It would be interesting to know what a factory would  be worth in a community where \" sentiment \" had died of asphyxia,  and where the interest of one class was left to determine the  terms on which industry should be conducted.  It is not denied that the sense of fairness and justice is strong  in business men; but we do claim that without strong ethical  feeling organized for common action, the means employer sets  the pace for all those who really desire to be honorable and fair.  Take an example from the phenomena of women\\'s wages.  Here sentiment is a powerful factor in reducing wages. While  the working girl is despised for kitchen labor; while the occupy-  tons open to women are overcrowded because the prejudices of  both men and women close others; so long will women suffer  from removable causes. So Professor Walker says: \"What is the  remedy? Agitation and the diffusion of correct ideas. Let gifted  women continue to appeal for public respect and sympathy for  their sisters in work; let the schools teach that public opinion  may powerfully affect wages, and that nothing which depends on  human volution is inexorable! . . . Efforts like these will not  fail to strengthen and support woman in her resort to market.\"  There is one field of practice in which a social scholar as a citizen  must enter,-the field of local government. His activity may  be limited, but here he fights for his altar and hearth. It is true  that here again he meets the hostility or merry contempt of a  certain class of \"practical\" men. Now it is the turn of the  scholar to find himself in company with the merchant, and both  of them classed by politicians as \"laymen.\" The local leaders  of intrigue give both to understand that they are out of place  and that they may as well let the machine alone,-it is too com-  located and mysterious for gentlemen to manage.  But it cannot really be pertinent for a scholar to deal with  those practical affairs which touch every interest of his life as a  citizen, a father, a patriot and an idealism. It may not be pleas-  ant work to fight petty robbers in defense of his little property,  the school of his children, the supply of light and protection, and  C    BUSINESS EN A Ns SOCIAL THEORISTS. 395  the essential conditions of health. Nothing but intellectual  importance can excuse any citizen, least of all the social scholar,  from a degree of direct effort on behalf of good local govern-  ment. He is liable to make mistakes, but these will not be so  fatal as the acts of men who sell or buy franchises under which  the community is made to serve the clique. If anything can  turn a quiet student into the noisy street, it is the conviction  that the public thoroughfare is being taken from him without  adequate recompense.  When the scholar -enters the sphere of practice, he must pre-  pare himself for the treatment given a man with a silk hat in the  bull-and-bear pit on a board of trade holiday; he becomes the  target for the widest boys. If he says anything which by any  chance tends to affect prices or nominations, he should not look  for reverence. That is an obsolete virtue in American practical  life. Nothing thinner than rhinoceros hide will do for an over-  coat where conflicting interests are at stake, and arrows are fly-  ing in all directions.  And yet the scientific method is needed along with the frac-  tica method. The general interest can be served only by the  union of science and art. The bronze captain on the bridge can  direct the ship in a storm or fog better than the author of  \" Synthetic Philosophy \" or \" Dynamic Sociology.\" Rude sailors  told the officials nobles to go below because they did \"assist  the storm.\" The best service of college professors when the  wind blows worst is to stay in bed and set an example of quiet-  ness and confidence. And yet the educated captain knows that  the mathematicians, astronomers, chemists, physicists and bilo-  lists have all contributed to his art. The more thoroughly he  knows the history of navigation the more he respects the school-  ars who have made his craft possible.  The more college graduates we have in the counting rooms  the more cordial and fruitful will be the relations between frac-  tica men and scholars. As \"scholarship\" comes to mean social  service, and is freed from medievalism and dialects, it will be  recognized and respected by the men who are driving the  C    396 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL Of SOCIOLOGY  machinery of production. New and improved stocks come from  cross-fertilization. \" Breeding in-and-in \" causes deterioration.  Study and counting room will be more. vigorous, sane and serv-  cable for an alliance.  Science is itself conservative and judicial. The rich trustees  of a university may well feel secure in keeping their hands off  academic freedom. The professors of a science do not belong  to a mutual admiration society. They are more nearly a swarm  of critics, makers of honey but armed with stings. No criticism  from the business world could be so persistent, pitiless and  remorseless as that with which real scholars pursue the pretender  and amateur. But aside from this co6operative chastisement the  very discipline of modern scientific method gets caution. No  man ever stated the difficulties in Darwinism more clearly than  Darwin himself. There is no class of men who so fully realize  the meaning of the oath to state \"the truth, the whole truth and  nothing but the truth.\" The methods of science have much in  common with the methods of business. Both are intolerant of  gaps in the chain of causation. Both demand absolute continuity  between end and means. Both are impatient of fog and spec-  nation.  In this sense science is eminently \"practical,\" because it  measures by the most exact methods and instruments of invest-  citation the available forces for attaining an end which seems  desirable. The scientific ideal is an exact balance between the  debuts and credits, the causes and results of human action.  There is an undetermined remainder, bad debts and losses, as in  financial settlements, but the ideal is accuracy.  The social position of the \"social theorist\" is an advantage.  The nature of his studies compel him to come into touch with  persons of all classes and interests. He hears and reads on all  sides. His associations are with the refined, and his ideals of  life are formed in the best company. But his professional pur-  suits compel him to weigh the claims of the entire community.  The recent introduction of the \"laboratory method\" in social-  og is a guarantee that no department of human life will be  C    BUSINESS EN AND SOCIAL THEORISTS. 397  neglected. Apart from the bitterness of competitive strife,  interested in public welfare as others are but not directly inter-  tested in rich or poor alone, the student of social phenomena  may be reasonably expected to bring to light and present for  consideration elements of social well-being which hot contest-  ants for immediate and class advantage are sure to overlook.  It is of the essence of democracy that the interests of all  should not be at the mercy of a few, but should be the care of  representatives of the entire community. Kings by \" divine  right,\" and feudal lords by grace of birth, have assumed that  they knew how to legislate for the \"lower classes\" better than  the chosen spokesman of these classes. Nothing but rude  blows of revolution and noisy artist petitions shook the ruling  classes of Britain out of this delusion. Monopolies of social  wisdom and virtue do not exist. The frank recognition of div-  son of intellectual labor and of common social concern is all  that is asked by the social theorist, and in an age when the pen  is fighter than sword or hammer, his claim is not likely to be  permanently ignored.

      "ANTI-MONOPOLY LEGISLATION IN THE UNITED  STATES.  RECENT legislation against trusts, monopolistic corporations,  and railway consolidations is the modern expression of a senti-  ment which finds its roots far back in English history. Modern  monopolies bear little resemblance to those which existed prior  to the middle of this century; yet the opposition to the latter,  taking shape in constitutions and statutes, has largely influenced  public opinion against modern capitalistic combinations. Modern  monopolies are the outgrowth of industrial and economic condi-  tions. The older ones were arbitrarily created by kings for the  benefit of favorites or for purposes of revenue. It was but natural,  therefore, that such monopolies should be vigorously attacked  during the long struggles for liberty.,  Monopolies, as being opposed to the natural freedom of  Englishmen, have been held to be contrary to the famous clauses  of the Great Charter which guarantee in essence the rights of  habeas corpus and trial by jury-the \"essential clauses,\" as  Hallam terms them, which \"protect the personal liberty and  property of all freemen, by giving security from arbitrary impris-  onment and arbitrary spoliation.\" It was not, however, until  the enormous abuses of monopolies arose in the time of Eliza-  beth, that a definite attack was made upon them. Under the  patents which the queen had so .lavishly bestowed upon her  favorites, the prices of a multitude of articles, most of which  were common necessaries of life, became ruinously high. The  opposition, after smoldering for many years, burst forth in i6oi  with such violence that Elizabeth yielded her cherished preroga-  tive. The evil flourished again under James I., and his last  parliament passed an act declaring monopolies and certain  For a description of this conflict, see Hallam, Taswell-Langmead, and other  writers on English constitutional history.  4\"1  C    4I2 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY.  other privileges opposed to the ancient liberties of Englishmen,  and void., The abuses were again revived by Charles I., and  almost every article consumed by the common people was  placed under control of irresponsible monopolies.  Thus the struggle went on until the people finally succeeded  in setting aside the royal prerogative by the Revolution of i688.  The bill of rights contained no express declaration against  monopolies; but it was made impossible for the king to grant them,  and the act passed in the latter part of the reign of James I. was  thus again made operative.  The English bill of rights was the model for the sections of  American constitutions bearing the same title. The gist of these  declarations was that the people had a right to security in their  persons, property, and privileges. All else was but elaboration of  this. In some form or other declarations of rights were made  by all the colonies long before the Revolution, some even pre-  ceding the English declaration.2 In I765 delegates from nine  colonies met in New York and published a declaration of the  rights of the people to inherent privileges of Englishmen.3  Again, in I774, delegates from all the colonies except Georgia  met in the first Continental Congress and issued a declaration  based- upon the English model and explicitly claiming the bene-  fits of the common law of England, and of such English statutes  as existed at the time of their colonization and which had been  found applicable to local circumstances. The Declaration of  Independence soon followed this with similar claims; and most  of the states then and thereafter organized incorporated bills of  rights in their constitutions, though several of the earliest con-  stitutions omit such formal declarations altogether.  Formal declarations of- fundamental principles of government  have doubtless served an important purpose and are still far  from valueless. But there is much truth in the statement made  by Mr. Kent in his \"Commentaries,\" that \"we weaken greatly  12I Jac. I.

Such a dec-  laration was made by Maryland in its first constitution in 1776,  and has been repeated in every constitution since adopted by  that state, namely, those of I8 5 1, I864, and I867. North Caro-  lina also incorporated this declaration in the constitution of  1776, and repeated it in the present constitution which was  adopted in i868. Tennessee declared against monopolies in the  first constitution of 1796, and repeated the clause in the two  constitutions since adopted in 1834 and I870. Arkansas incor-  porated the same declaration in the first constitution, adopted in  I836, repeated it in the reconstruction constitution of I864,  omitted it from that adopted in i868, but replaced it in that of  I874, which still stands. The Republic of Texas incorporated  this clause in the constitution of I836, and it has been retained  in every constitution adopted by the state, namely, those of  I845, i866, i868, and I876. Florida made this declaration in  the constitution of i838, seven years before admission to the  Union, repeated it in the reconstruction constitution of I865, but  omitted it from the present constitution, which was adopted in  i 868. The pro-slavery constitution of Kansas in I 8 5 7 contained  this clause, but it has not been repeated in the later constitutions.  New Mexico has recently made the-same declaration, and it will  doubtless stand in the constitution when that territory is admitted  to the Union.2  It is noticeable that only southern states have made this dec-  1 Lecture XXIV., 13th edition, Vol. II., p. 9.\n",

It is also noticeable that the  clauses in the later constitutions are copied almost word for  word from the first constitution of either Maryland or North  Carolina. It is perhaps not far from correct to say that the con-  ventions which framed the later constitutions were simply  anxious to get the finest phrases they could find, and adopted  what struck their fancy, just as committees on resolutions of  thanks or respect are likely to use the words of any similar  reports with which they are familiar; and that any of the dec-  larations made since the beginning of this century mean no more  to those making them than is meant by the declaration fre-  quently found in bills of rights, that the state is formed by \" social  compact.\"  The first declarations doubtless had real meaning, and were  made perhaps because tobacco or some other staple had been  monopolized, or because favors had been granted to individuals  under the proprietary governments, and it was feared they might  be repeated by the states. In confirmation of this latter sup-  position it may be stated that always immediately following the  denunciation of monopolies is found the prohibition of hereditary  emoluments, honors, and privileges.  Whatever the cause of these declarations, it is very evident  that \"monopoly\" now means something vastly different from  that which the commons so vigorously opposed in the times of  Elizabeth and James, and against which the founders of our  nation had such deep-rooted antipathy. Then it meant an insti-  tution founded and kept in existence by royal favoritism; now it  means an institution which may have come into existence with-  out direct governmental assistance, and which may have main-  tained itself in spite of administrative and legislative opposition.  In spite of this difference, the old opposition, perpetuated in  our constitutions and handed down in tradition, has had a potent  influence in shaping the popular hostility to the modern monop-  oly. This influence has been most powerful in the political  sphere. Monopolies are opposed because they are supposed to  C    ANTI-MONOPOLY LEGISLATION. 415  be inimical to our free institutions. It is felt that they should  not be tolerated, both because the few are supposed to get undue  advantage of the many, and because of the ability of powerful  corporations to corrupt legislatures.  Monopolies are further antagonized because they are opposed  to the prevailing economic philosophy of the American people.  The doctrine of laissez faire has probably been more completely  engrafted upQn the political and industrial institutions of this  country, and more thoroughly absorbed into the consciousness  of the people, than anywhere else in the world. The individ-  ualistic theories in philosophy, politics, and economics were most  widely accepted at the time the colonies achieved their inde-  pendence and formed their state and national governments.  The doctrines of the French philosophers were especially  influential. It is not to be expected, however, that the early con-  stitutions and statutes will show any effort to prevent commer-  cial combinations and restrictions of competition. The country  was largely agricultural, and the vast unoccupied territory ren-  dered impossible monopolies in that branch of industry which  was generally pursued. Moreover, when manufactures began  to develop, the more rapid development of the country and  its growth in population made it impossible for the evils of  competition to bear heavily upon any industry. This condition  of affairs continued until the close of the Civil War. No  attempts were made to restrict monopolies, because monopolies  did not exist; and since constant progress was seen to be pos-  sible under the reign of free competition, it was very generally  supposed that free competition was the necessary condition of  all material prosperity.,  Thus it has resulted that on account of political tradition,  and political and economic philosophy, as well as because of the  good results credited to free competition, monopolistic com-  binations have been almost universally regarded as \" odious,  contrary to the spirit of a free government, and the principles of  commerce.\"  \"The tariff legislation is the only evidence of inconsistence with this theory.  C    4I6 THE AMERICA N JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY.  As the development of industries proceeded, the evils of  unlimited competition began to be felt, and managers of indus-  tries which suffered most began to devise methods by which  those evils could be mitigated. Before the war some efforts at  combination had been made in the anthracite coal business and in  the telegraph and railroad service in some sections.' After the  crisis of I873, renewed efforts were made to avoid the evils of  unrestricted competition. As a consequence a dread of monop-  olies began to be felt, and manifested itself in the legal restric-  tions which were embodied in constitutions and laws.  The first combinations to be attacked were the railroads and  telegraph lines, because these were more apparent than the capital-  istic monopolies that were being formed. Railroad and telegraph  companies were always corporations, and always acquired privi-  leges under the public right of eminent domain. Trade com-  binations were frequently not corporations, and were so little the  creatures of the state that the right of state interference was not  so clearly perceived. There has never been any doubt as to the  right of the state to keep corporations, which are its creatures,  under strict surveillance. It is a principle of law that corpora-  tions can engage only in the activities and enjoy the privileges  expressly defined in their charters,2 and cannot consolidate with-  out the express sanction of the state. This sanction may be  granted by a general law, by the charters of the corporations  combining, by a special law authorizing consolidation, or by a  special law ratifying an unauthorized consolidation. The states  of Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut,  Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, Mississippi, Ten-  nessee, Kentucky and Oregon have no general laws authorizing  consolidation. In these states, at least, nearly all consolidations  of corporations, since public opinion would prevent special per-  mission, would be illegal.  The right of the state to regulate, under its police powers, all  matters that affect public policy is also recognized. Several of  \"Spelling: \"On Trusts and Monopolies.\"  2See \"American and English Encyclopaedia of Law,\" Vol. IV., Art. Corpora-  tions.  C    ANTI- MONOPOL Y LEGISLA TION. 417  the states have reserved this right in their constitutions. Ala-  bama, Colorado, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, and  West Virginia provide that the right of eminent domain shall  never be abridged. Colorado, Missouri, and Pennsylvania provide  that the police power shall never be abridged. Delaware, Kan-  sas, and Pennsylvania reserve the right to alter or revoke any  charter granted to corporations.  In harmony with these principles - some of which, however,  have been but recently expressed-the states began to take steps  to prevent the consolidation of these quasi-public corporations.  In i868, a provision was made by the constitution! of South  Carolina for the regulation of \"the public use of all franchises  which have heretofore been, or hereafter may be created or  granted by or under the authority of the state;\" and for limita-  tion by law of tolls, imposts, and other charges. In I870, Illi-  nois prohibited by constitutional enactment2 the consolidation  of competing railroads. West Virginia3 (I872), Pennsylvania4  (I873), Nebraskas and Missouri6 (I875), and Colorado7 ( I876),  incorporated like prohibitions into their constitutions. Pennsylva-  nia8 (I873), Nebraska9 and Alabama lo (I875), and Colorado,\",  ( 1876), took the same steps with regard to telegraph companies.  Constitutional declarations of the right of the state to regulate  the rates of transportation were made by Illinois!2 (I870), Penn-  sylvaniaI3 (i873), Missouri14and Nebraska'15 (I875), and Texas'6  (I876).  In addition to these constitutional changes, many of the  states established railroad commissions, and enacted laws having  much the same purpose as these clauses in the constitutions.  After two years of discussion, the United States Congress passed  the Inter-state Commerce Act, January 14, I887. The work of the  'Art. XII., Sec. 5. 9 Art. XI., Sec. 3.\n",

It is sufficient for our purpose  to remember that all such legislation was directed principally  against pools and combinations, though the prevention of dis  crimination in rates is no small part of the work of the commis  sions. Combinations and pools have not been effectually stopped,  and many thoughtful men are now seriously questioning the  wisdom of the attempts to do so. Mr. Reagan, who was chiefly  instrumental in inserting the anti-pooling clause in the Interstate  Commerce Law, has recently expressed the opinion that pools  and combinations under governmental supervision are desirable.z  The activity in the various states against railroad consolida-  tion did much to stimulate public opinion against ordinary com-  mercial combinations which, during all this time, were develop-  ing. Legislation against them could not take shape, because it was  impossible to foresee the conditions which it was desirable to avoid.  From the time of the crisis of I873, the modern trust had been  gradually maturing; but it did not take definite shape until the  Standard Oil Trust was formed in I882. This is not saying that  capitalistic monopolies did not exist before that date; for the  petroleum market was practically monopolized before the trust  was formed. But there were no combinations which could be  regarded as \"conspiracies in restraint of trade\" until the date  named. From this time, there were numerous legislative inquiries  into the monopoly question, always prosecuted with a desire to  preserve freedom of competition. These inquiries were always  endorsed by popular opinion, and were pushed with new vigor  when instances of actual crookedness and corruption were  revealed.  The first definite constitutional enactment with reference to  this question is found in Georgia in I877. This was in reality  directed against the consolidation of competing railroads; but  after the rise of capitalistic monopolies, it was found that it  could be employed against them also.2 This provided that;-  \"Report of Interstate Commerce Commission, I892, P. 5I.\n",

No specific anti-trust laws were enacted until I889. At that  time laws were placed upon the statute books of the states of Kan-  sas, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina,Tennes-  see, and Texas. The new states of Montana, North Dakota, Wash-  ington, and Wyoming introduced similar provisions into their con-  stitutions. In I 890 anti-trust laws were passed by Iowa, Kentucky,  Louisiana, Mississippi, South Dakota, and by the territory of  Oklahoma. Kentucky and Missouri introduced similar clauses  into their constitutions in I89I. In the latter year anti-trust  laws were passed by the states of Alabama, Illinois, Minnesota,  and the territory of New Mexico; and amendments to the former  laws were passed by Missouri and Tennessee. In i892 a short  anti-combination clause was inserted in a general law concerning  corporations passed by New York; and an amendment to the  former law was passed by Louisiana. Amendments were passed  in I 893 by Illinois, Minnesota, and South Dakota; and the same  year California prohibited monopolies in live stock, and Nebraska  in coal and lumber. North Dakota passed a law in I895, to  take effect January I, I896, prohibiting combinations in grain  and live stock, but having some general anti-trust features; and  Missouri passed another amendment to the law of that state.,  The United States law was approved by the President, July 2,  I 890; and the Tariff Law of I 894 contains a section bearing upon  the same subject, but having special reference to importations.  The most complete definition of a trust is given in the Illinois  amendment of I893, though the Texas law of I889 covers\n",
      " nearly the same ground. The Illinois definition is as follows:  \"VON HALLE, Trusts, pp. 17, I8, states that Wisconsin passed an anti-trust law\n",
      " in I892. The Secretary of State writes that Wisconsin has no such law. I am unable  to reconcile the two statements. VON HALLE also omits Mississippi and Oklahoma  from his list, and has several minor divergencies from the statement above given.  C    420 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY.  A trust is a combination of capital, skill, or acts by two or more  persons, firms, corporations, or associations of persons, or of two or  nmore of them, for either, any, or all of the following purposes: First,  to create or carry out restrictions in trade. Second, to limit or reduce  the production, or increase or reduce the price of merchandise or  commodities. Third, to prevent competition in manufacture, making,  transportation, sale, or purchase of merchandise, produce, or com-  modities. Fourth, to fix at any standard or figure whereby its price to  the public shall be in any manner controlled or established upon any  article or commodity of merchandise, produce, or manufacture  intended for sale, use, or consumption in this state; or to establish  any pretended agency whereby the sale of any such article or com-  modity shall be covered up and made to appear to be for the original  vendor, for like purpose or purposes, and to enable such original  vendor or manufacturer to control the wholesale or retail price of any  such article or commodity after the title to such article or commodity  shall have passed from such vendor or manufacturer. Fifth, to make  or enter into, or examine or carry out any contract, obligation, or  agreement of any kind or description by which they shall bind or  have bound themselves not to sell, dispose of, or transport any article  or commodity, or article of trade, use, merchandise, commerce, or  consumption below a common standard figure, or card or list price;  or by which they shall agree in any manner to keep the price of such  article, commodity, or transportation at a fixed or graduated figure; or  by which they shall in any manner establish or settle the price of any  article or commodity or transportation between them or themselves  and others, to preclude a free and unrestricted competition among  themselves or others in the sale or transportation of any such article  or commiiodity; or by which they shall agree to pool, combine, or  unite any interest they may have in connection with the sale or  transportation of any such article or commodity that its price might in  any miannaer be affected.  The various laws differ from one another in no important  particulars. They agree in declaring all combinations in restraint  of free competition illegal. The United States law differs from  the state laws only in its application to interstate commerce and  combinations in the territories and the District of Columbia.  Most of the laws are directed against monopolies in ordinary  C    ANTI- MONOPOLY LEGISLA TION. 421  merchandise; but Kansas includes combinations which control  the loan or use of money, fix attorneys' and physicians' fees,  control the cost or rate of insurance, or which tend to advance  the rate of interest for the borrower, and South Dakota declares  that it is against public policy and illegal to form a combination  to prevent a fair competition for a low rate of interest.  The provisions of the laws do not apply to agricultural pro-  ducts, and live stock while in the hands of the producer, in Michi-  gan, Mississippi, Nebraska and Texas, and, with exceptions, in  Alabama. Most of the acts provide that foreign trusts operating  in violation of them shall be prohibited from doing business in  the states enacting the laws. Some of the laws prohibit corpora-  tions from holding trust certificates or stock.  The penalties for violation of the laws are most severe. The  United States law fixes the penalty at not exceeding $5000 fine,  or not exceeding one year's imprisonment, or both punishments.  In addition to this, property in transit shall be forfeited,  and any person who may be injured by a trust may recover  threefold the damages sustained, cost of suit, and attorney's fee.  The penalties in the various states are as follows: Oklahoma,  fine of $50 to $500; Alabama, $500 to $2000; Kentucky and  Louisiana, $500 to $5000; Illinois, $500 to $i5,000; Maine, $5  to $Io,ooo; Minnesota, $Ioo to $5000, and imprisonment for  one to ten years; Missouri, $Ioo per day; Nebraska, not exceed-  ing $Iooo, or imprisonment not exceeding six months; Tennes-  see, $250 for first offense, $500 for the second; Texas and Mis-  sissippi, $50 to $5000, and imprisonment for one to ten years,  and $50 for each additional day's offense. Officers and agents  are liable to the same penalty in Alabama, Kentucky, Louisiana,  Missouri and North Dakota, and to fines of $200 to $Iooo and  imprisonment, in Illinois and New Mexico. If assent to the  illegal agreement is not withdrawn within thirty days in Illinois,  Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota and Nebraska, the cor-  poration shall forfeit its charter and all rights and franchises.  It is also provided in many cases that obligations to such com-  binations need not be regarded.  C    422 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY.  The laws in question have been uniformly upheld; but they  have, as a rule, simply harassed trade without accomplishing the  real end which they had in view. The very evident evils result-  ing from the concentration of power in the hands of a few  irresponsible trust managers, and the questionable methods by  which combinations have frequently been formed, have aroused  the public to action. Naturally then, with the prejudice against  monopolies deep-seated in the public consciousness, legislation  has been directed against the trust as such. It is easy to see  that the popular prejudice is, in part, unjustifiable; for, without  apologizing for many unscrupulous acts done by trusts, and  recognizing the danger from irresponsible power, it may still be  claimed that very great benefits arise from the economy of  management, and the adjustment of production to the needs of  consumption, made possible by wise and honorable trust manage-  ment. Add to this the fact that prohibitory efforts have thus  far proved abortive, and it becomes apparent that this, like a  great deal of other social legislation, has been based upon a very  imperfect knowledge of the facts involved.  Aside from this, the laws would fail of complete success in  destroying monoplies, because none of them would prevent a  single person from gaining control of an industry. With the  prevailing view of the liberty of the individual, it is necessary to  find a combination or conspiracy, or a corporation created by the  state, to attack. It is not that individual monopolists are not  regarded with suspicion; for the opposition to department stores  and similar enterprises is frequently pronounced. But these  have not yet been declared opposed to public policy; and a  single powerful manufacturer or merchant may freeze out all  competitors, yet without violating these anti-monopoly laws;  while an individual or a corporation that might try to buy out or  cooperate with competitors would be guilty of conspiracy. In  this respect we have fallen below the anti-monoply law of the  last parliament of James I.; for the old monopolists were indi-  viduals or individual companies, as the word itself indicates  (povos+?rwXC?ouat); and were in no sense trusts or cooperative asso-  C    ANTI- MONVOPOL Y LEGISLA TION. 423  ciations. It was admitted by the supreme court in the sugar  refineries casex that congress did not confine itself to the com-  mon law sense of the term \"as implying an exclusive control, by  authority, of one branch of industry without legal right of any  other person to interfere therewith by competition or otherwise,  but it includes engrossing as well, and covers controlling the  market by contracts securing the advantage of selling alone or  exclusively all, or some considerable portion, of a particular kind of  merchandise or commodity to the detriment of the public; and  that such contracts amount to that restraint of trade or com-  merce declared to be illegal.\" Evidently, then, if the laws aim  not -at the contract, but at the fact of irresponsible power,  they need some expansion.  The generally unserviceable character of the anti-trust legis-  lation must convince us that the question is no more settled than  it was before the legislators began to grapple with it-at least  existing laws do not settle it. As Von Halle says, \"More may  be expected finally from the decisions of the courts. Legal  judgments depend upon the conception of public policy; and as  this conception is subject to change, the law-creating action of  the courts is likely to change also. That this is possible, and  indeed is done by a process of quiet and natural progress, is the  very thing that constitutes the strength of the English common  law.\"'2  It may be that these anti-monopoly laws, futile although  most of them are, will serve a purpose in bringing into the  courts a problem that needs solution. A victory has undoubtedly  been gained in compelling the trusts to become incorporated,  and in making so much of their business public. Then, too, the  general recognition of the right of the state to prohibit that  which is opposed to public policy is likely to have most salutary  results. While, in the case under consideration, the exercise of  authority has been directed to the maintenance of conditions of  free competition, the policy itself is the reverse of laissezfaire.  I U. S. vs. Knight, I56 U. S., IO.  2\" Trusts,\" p. 109.  C    424 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY.  That old doctrine has worked out its own destruction. On the  one hand, powerful business interests will not let the weaker  ones alone; on the other, the state dares not let the powerful  combinations alone.  The right and duty of the state to preserve conditions con-  ducive to the general welfare being recognized, it may be  expected that mistakes and blunders made because of ignorance  of the real meaning of new industrial forces will be rectified as  those forces are better understood. The element due to dema-  gogism will also doubtless be sifted out. While it is assumed  that monopolies \"cannot be granted in such ordinary vocations  as can be left open to all to the common benefit,\" it has always  been recognized that they \"may be given as a matter of regula-  tion, where the business is such that the public interest can be  best subserved and protected by confiding it to one person, or  association of persons, who shall manage it exclusively.  This obligation to serve the public impartially would seem to be  an essential incident to any grant of a monopoly, since without  it, it would be impossible to justify the grant on public  grounds.\" I  Presumably, then, if it is found that a trust can best sub-  serve the interests of the public, and can be made to serve it  impartially, there is nothing in the spirit of our laws to prevent  a change of attitude toward such combinations. The right of a  state to pass laws of this sort is based upon its general right of  police regulation. This right is abridged somewhat by the con-  stitutional provision that a state cannot interfere with interstate  commerce; but a decision of the Supreme Court, rendered  January 2I, I895, in the case above referred to against the con-  solidated Philadelphia and New Jersey sugar refineries, reserves  to the United States the right to regulate trade and com-  merce only, and leaves the regulation of the acquisition and  control of property to the states. Under these circumstances  the responsibility is thrown upon the -states. With the further  progress of the co6perative movement, which is sure to come,  X Cooley, \" Constitutional Law,\" p. 247.  C    ANTI- MONOPOLY LEGISLA TION. 425  we may expect further legislation becoming more and more  rational; but the decision of the individual cases, with due  allowance for time and place and in harmony with the principles  of common law -which means that abandonment by a privileged  party of its duty to the public will not be tolerated -will do  more to solve the problem than legislation of the kind we have  been considering.  The solution will probably be something like that suggested  by Von Halle in his conclusion: \"It is my belief that the  future belongs neither to the prophets of individualism, nor to  the ideals of the social-democrats. Its next phases belong to social  reorganization. And the probability is that this will show a cor-  porate character, and will be sustained and controlled by public  J. D.

      "\u001b[43m\u001b[1mANTI\u001b[0m-MONOPOLY LEGISLATION IN THE UNITED  STATES.  RECENT legislation against trusts, monopolistic corporations,  and railway consolidations is the modern expression of a senti-  ment which finds its roots far back in English history. Modern  monopolies bear little resemblance to those which existed prior  to the middle of this century; yet the opposition to the latter,  taking shape in constitutions and statutes, has largely influenced  public opinion against modern capitalistic combinations. Modern  monopolies are the outgrowth of industrial and economic condi-  tions. The older ones were arbitrarily created by kings for the  benefit of favorites or for purposes of revenue. It was but natural,  therefore, that such monopolies should be vigorously attacked  during the long struggles for liberty.,  Monopolies, as being opposed to the natural freedom of  Englishmen, have been held to be contrary to the famous clauses  of the Great Charter which guarantee in essence the rights of  habeas corpus and trial by jury-the \"essential clauses,\" as  Hallam terms them, which \"protect the personal liberty and  property of all freemen, by giving security from arbitrary impris-  onment and arbitrary spoliation.\" It was not, however, until  the enormous abuses of monopolies arose in the time of Eliza-  beth, that a definite attack was made upon them. Under the  patents which the queen had so .lavishly bestowed upon her  favorites, the prices of a multitude of articles, most of which  were common necessaries of life, became ruinously high. The  opposition, after smoldering for many years, burst forth in i6oi  with such violence that Elizabeth yielded her cherished preroga-  tive. The evil flourished again under James I., and his last  parliament passed an act declaring monopolies and certain  For a description of this conflict, see Hallam, Taswell-Langmead, and other  writers on English constitutional history.  4\"1  C    4I2 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY.  other privileges opposed to the ancient liberties of Englishmen,  and void., The abuses were again revived by Charles I., and  almost every article consumed by the common people was  placed under control of irresponsible monopolies.  Thus the struggle went on until the people finally succeeded  in setting aside the royal prerogative by the Revolution of i688.  The bill of rights contained no express declaration against  monopolies; but it was made impossible for the king to grant them,  and the act passed in the latter part of the reign of James I. was  thus again made operative.  The English bill of rights was the model for the sections of  American constitutions bearing the same title. The gist of these  declarations was that the people had a right to security in their  persons, property, and privileges. All else was but elaboration of  this. In some form or other declarations of rights were made  by all the colonies long before the Revolution, some even pre-  ceding the English declaration.2 In I765 delegates from nine  colonies met in New York and published a declaration of the  rights of the people to inherent privileges of Englishmen.3  Again, in I774, delegates from all the colonies except Georgia  met in the first Continental Congress and issued a declaration  based- upon the English model and explicitly claiming the bene-  fits of the common law of England, and of such English statutes  as existed at the time of their colonization and which had been  found applicable to local circumstances. The Declaration of  Independence soon followed this with similar claims; and most  of the states then and thereafter organized incorporated bills of  rights in their constitutions, though several of the earliest con-  stitutions omit such formal declarations altogether.  Formal declarations of- fundamental principles of government  have doubtless served an important purpose and are still far  from valueless. But there is much truth in the statement made  by Mr. Kent in his \"Commentaries,\" that \"we weaken greatly  12I Jac. I.

Such a dec-  laration was made by Maryland in its first constitution in 1776,  and has been repeated in every constitution since adopted by  that state, namely, those of I8 5 1, I864, and I867. North Caro-  lina also incorporated this declaration in the constitution of  1776, and repeated it in the present constitution which was  adopted in i868. Tennessee declared against monopolies in the  first constitution of 1796, and repeated the clause in the two  constitutions since adopted in 1834 and I870. Arkansas incor-  porated the same declaration in the first constitution, adopted in  I836, repeated it in the reconstruction constitution of I864,  omitted it from that adopted in i868, but replaced it in that of  I874, which still stands. The Republic of Texas incorporated  this clause in the constitution of I836, and it has been retained  in every constitution adopted by the state, namely, those of  I845, i866, i868, and I876. Florida made this declaration in  the constitution of i838, seven years before admission to the  Union, repeated it in the reconstruction constitution of I865, but  omitted it from the present constitution, which was adopted in  i 868. The pro-slavery constitution of Kansas in I 8 5 7 contained  this clause, but it has not been repeated in the later constitutions.  New Mexico has recently made the-same declaration, and it will  doubtless stand in the constitution when that territory is admitted  to the Union.2  It is noticeable that only southern states have made this dec-  1 Lecture XXIV., 13th edition, Vol. II., p. 9.\n",
      " 2In addition to these the Massachusetts declaration of rights, adopted in 1780,  states: \" No man or corporation or association of men have any other title to obtain  advantage or particular and exclusive privileges distinct from those of the community  than what rises from the consideration of services rendered to the public.\"  C    4I4 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY.  laration, except that Kansas did so in one instance; but this  was under southern influence. It is also noticeable that the  clauses in the later constitutions are copied almost word for  word from the first constitution of either Maryland or North  Carolina. It is perhaps not far from correct to say that the con-  ventions which framed the later constitutions were simply  anxious to get the finest phrases they could find, and adopted  what struck their fancy, just as committees on resolutions of  thanks or respect are likely to use the words of any similar  reports with which they are familiar; and that any of the dec-  larations made since the beginning of this century mean no more  to those making them than is meant by the declaration fre-  quently found in bills of rights, that the state is formed by \" social  compact.\"  The first declarations doubtless had real meaning, and were  made perhaps because tobacco or some other staple had been  monopolized, or because favors had been granted to individuals  under the proprietary governments, and it was feared they might  be repeated by the states. In confirmation of this latter sup-  position it may be stated that always immediately following the  denunciation of monopolies is found the prohibition of hereditary  emoluments, honors, and privileges.  Whatever the cause of these declarations, it is very evident  that \"monopoly\" now means something vastly different from  that which the commons so vigorously opposed in the times of  Elizabeth and James, and against which the founders of our  nation had such deep-rooted antipathy. Then it meant an insti-  tution founded and kept in existence by royal favoritism; now it  means an institution which may have come into existence with-  out direct governmental assistance, and which may have main-  tained itself in spite of administrative and legislative opposition.  In spite of this difference, the old opposition, perpetuated in  our constitutions and handed down in tradition, has had a potent  influence in shaping the popular hostility to the modern monop-  oly. This influence has been most powerful in the political  sphere. Monopolies are opposed because they are supposed to  C    \u001b[43m\u001b[1mANTI\u001b[0m-MONOPOLY LEGISLATION. 415  be inimical to our free institutions. It is felt that they should  not be tolerated, both because the few are supposed to get undue  advantage of the many, and because of the ability of powerful  corporations to corrupt legislatures.  Monopolies are further antagonized because they are opposed  to the prevailing economic philosophy of the American people.  The doctrine of laissez faire has probably been more completely  engrafted upQn the political and industrial institutions of this  country, and more thoroughly absorbed into the consciousness  of the people, than anywhere else in the world. The individ-  ualistic theories in philosophy, politics, and economics were most  widely accepted at the time the colonies achieved their inde-  pendence and formed their state and national governments.  The doctrines of the French philosophers were especially  influential. It is not to be expected, however, that the early con-  stitutions and statutes will show any effort to prevent commer-  cial combinations and restrictions of competition. The country  was largely agricultural, and the vast unoccupied territory ren-  dered impossible monopolies in that branch of industry which  was generally pursued. Moreover, when manufactures began  to develop, the more rapid development of the country and  its growth in population made it impossible for the evils of  competition to bear heavily upon any industry. This condition  of affairs continued until the close of the Civil War. No  attempts were made to restrict monopolies, because monopolies  did not exist; and since constant progress was seen to be pos-  sible under the reign of free competition, it was very generally  supposed that free competition was the necessary condition of  all material prosperity.,  Thus it has resulted that on account of political tradition,  and political and economic philosophy, as well as because of the  good results credited to free competition, monopolistic com-  binations have been almost universally regarded as \" odious,  contrary to the spirit of a free government, and the principles of  commerce.\"  \"The tariff legislation is the only evidence of inconsistence with this theory.  C    4I6 THE AMERICA N JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY.  As the development of industries proceeded, the evils of  unlimited competition began to be felt, and managers of indus-  tries which suffered most began to devise methods by which  those evils could be mitigated. Before the war some efforts at  combination had been made in the anthracite coal business and in  the telegraph and railroad service in some sections.' After the  crisis of I873, renewed efforts were made to avoid the evils of  unrestricted competition. As a consequence a dread of monop-  olies began to be felt, and manifested itself in the legal restric-  tions which were embodied in constitutions and laws.  The first combinations to be attacked were the railroads and  telegraph lines, because these were more apparent than the capital-  istic monopolies that were being formed. Railroad and telegraph  companies were always corporations, and always acquired privi-  leges under the public right of eminent domain. Trade com-  binations were frequently not corporations, and were so little the  creatures of the state that the right of state interference was not  so clearly perceived. There has never been any doubt as to the  right of the state to keep corporations, which are its creatures,  under strict surveillance. It is a principle of law that corpora-  tions can engage only in the activities and enjoy the privileges  expressly defined in their charters,2 and cannot consolidate with-  out the express sanction of the state. This sanction may be  granted by a general law, by the charters of the corporations  combining, by a special law authorizing consolidation, or by a  special law ratifying an unauthorized consolidation. The states  of Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut,  Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia, Mississippi, Ten-  nessee, Kentucky and Oregon have no general laws authorizing  consolidation. In these states, at least, nearly all consolidations  of corporations, since public opinion would prevent special per-  mission, would be illegal.  The right of the state to regulate, under its police powers, all  matters that affect public policy is also recognized.

Delaware, Kan-  sas, and Pennsylvania reserve the right to alter or revoke any  charter granted to corporations.  In harmony with these principles - some of which, however,  have been but recently expressed-the states began to take steps  to prevent the consolidation of these quasi-public corporations.  In i868, a provision was made by the constitution! of South  Carolina for the regulation of \"the public use of all franchises  which have heretofore been, or hereafter may be created or  granted by or under the authority of the state;\" and for limita-  tion by law of tolls, imposts, and other charges. In I870, Illi-  nois prohibited by constitutional enactment2 the consolidation  of competing railroads. West Virginia3 (I872), Pennsylvania4  (I873), Nebraskas and Missouri6 (I875), and Colorado7 ( I876),  incorporated like prohibitions into their constitutions. Pennsylva-  nia8 (I873), Nebraska9 and Alabama lo (I875), and Colorado,\",  ( 1876), took the same steps with regard to telegraph companies.  Constitutional declarations of the right of the state to regulate  the rates of transportation were made by Illinois!2 (I870), Penn-  sylvaniaI3 (i873), Missouri14and Nebraska'15 (I875), and Texas'6  (I876).  In addition to these constitutional changes, many of the  states established railroad commissions, and enacted laws having  much the same purpose as these clauses in the constitutions.  After two years of discussion, the United States Congress passed  the Inter-state Commerce Act, January 14, I887. The work of the  'Art. XII., Sec. 5. 9 Art. XI., Sec. 3.\n",

It is sufficient for our purpose  to remember that all such legislation was directed principally  against pools and combinations, though the prevention of dis  crimination in rates is no small part of the work of the commis  sions. Combinations and pools have not been effectually stopped,  and many thoughtful men are now seriously questioning the  wisdom of the attempts to do so. Mr. Reagan, who was chiefly  instrumental in inserting the anti-pooling clause in the Interstate  Commerce Law, has recently expressed the opinion that pools  and combinations under governmental supervision are desirable.z  The activity in the various states against railroad consolida-  tion did much to stimulate public opinion against ordinary com-  mercial combinations which, during all this time, were develop-  ing. Legislation against them could not take shape, because it was  impossible to foresee the conditions which it was desirable to avoid.  From the time of the crisis of I873, the modern trust had been  gradually maturing; but it did not take definite shape until the  Standard Oil Trust was formed in I882. This is not saying that  capitalistic monopolies did not exist before that date; for the  petroleum market was practically monopolized before the trust  was formed. But there were no combinations which could be  regarded as \"conspiracies in restraint of trade\" until the date  named. From this time, there were numerous legislative inquiries  into the monopoly question, always prosecuted with a desire to  preserve freedom of competition. These inquiries were always  endorsed by popular opinion, and were pushed with new vigor  when instances of actual crookedness and corruption were  revealed.  The first definite constitutional enactment with reference to  this question is found in Georgia in I877. This was in reality  directed against the consolidation of competing railroads; but  after the rise of capitalistic monopolies, it was found that it  could be employed against them also.2 This provided that;-  \"Report of Interstate Commerce Commission, I892, P. 5I.\n",

C    A NTI- MONOPOL Y LEGISLA TION. 419  \"The General Assembly shall have no power to authorize any  corporation to make any contract or agreement whatever with  any (other) corporation, which may have the effect, or be  intended to have the effect to defeat or lessen competition in  their respective business, or to encourage monopoly; and all  such contracts or agreements shall be illegal or void.'  No specific anti-trust laws were enacted until I889. At that  time laws were placed upon the statute books of the states of Kan-  sas, Maine, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina,Tennes-  see, and Texas. The new states of Montana, North Dakota, Wash-  ington, and Wyoming introduced similar provisions into their con-  stitutions. In I 890 anti-trust laws were passed by Iowa, Kentucky,  Louisiana, Mississippi, South Dakota, and by the territory of  Oklahoma. Kentucky and Missouri introduced similar clauses  into their constitutions in I89I. In the latter year anti-trust  laws were passed by the states of Alabama, Illinois, Minnesota,  and the territory of New Mexico; and amendments to the former  laws were passed by Missouri and Tennessee. In i892 a short  anti-combination clause was inserted in a general law concerning  corporations passed by New York; and an amendment to the  former law was passed by Louisiana. Amendments were passed  in I 893 by Illinois, Minnesota, and South Dakota; and the same  year California prohibited monopolies in live stock, and Nebraska  in coal and lumber. North Dakota passed a law in I895, to  take effect January I, I896, prohibiting combinations in grain  and live stock, but having some general anti-trust features; and  Missouri passed another amendment to the law of that state.,  The United States law was approved by the President, July 2,  I 890; and the Tariff Law of I 894 contains a section bearing upon  the same subject, but having special reference to importations.  The most complete definition of a trust is given in the Illinois  amendment of I893, though the Texas law of I889 covers\n",
      " nearly the same ground. The Illinois definition is as follows:  \"VON HALLE, Trusts, pp. 17, I8, states that Wisconsin passed an anti-trust law\n",
      " in I892. The Secretary of State writes that Wisconsin has no such law. I am unable  to reconcile the two statements. VON HALLE also omits Mississippi and Oklahoma  from his list, and has several minor divergencies from the statement above given.  C    420 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY.  A trust is a combination of capital, skill, or acts by two or more  persons, firms, corporations, or associations of persons, or of two or  nmore of them, for either, any, or all of the following purposes: First,  to create or carry out restrictions in trade. Second, to limit or reduce  the production, or increase or reduce the price of merchandise or  commodities. Third, to prevent competition in manufacture, making,  transportation, sale, or purchase of merchandise, produce, or com-  modities. Fourth, to fix at any standard or figure whereby its price to  the public shall be in any manner controlled or established upon any  article or commodity of merchandise, produce, or manufacture  intended for sale, use, or consumption in this state; or to establish  any pretended agency whereby the sale of any such article or com-  modity shall be covered up and made to appear to be for the original  vendor, for like purpose or purposes, and to enable such original  vendor or manufacturer to control the wholesale or retail price of any  such article or commodity after the title to such article or commodity  shall have passed from such vendor or manufacturer. Fifth, to make  or enter into, or examine or carry out any contract, obligation, or  agreement of any kind or description by which they shall bind or  have bound themselves not to sell, dispose of, or transport any article  or commodity, or article of trade, use, merchandise, commerce, or  consumption below a common standard figure, or card or list price;  or by which they shall agree in any manner to keep the price of such  article, commodity, or transportation at a fixed or graduated figure; or  by which they shall in any manner establish or settle the price of any  article or commodity or transportation between them or themselves  and others, to preclude a free and unrestricted competition among  themselves or others in the sale or transportation of any such article  or commiiodity; or by which they shall agree to pool, combine, or  unite any interest they may have in connection with the sale or  transportation of any such article or commodity that its price might in  any miannaer be affected.  The various laws differ from one another in no important  particulars. They agree in declaring all combinations in restraint  of free competition illegal. The United States law differs from  the state laws only in its application to interstate commerce and  combinations in the territories and the District of Columbia.  Most of the laws are directed against monopolies in ordinary  C    \u001b[43m\u001b[1mANTI\u001b[0m- MONOPOLY LEGISLA TION. 421  merchandise; but Kansas includes combinations which control  the loan or use of money, fix attorneys' and physicians' fees,  control the cost or rate of insurance, or which tend to advance  the rate of interest for the borrower, and South Dakota declares  that it is against public policy and illegal to form a combination  to prevent a fair competition for a low rate of interest.  The provisions of the laws do not apply to agricultural pro-  ducts, and live stock while in the hands of the producer, in Michi-  gan, Mississippi, Nebraska and Texas, and, with exceptions, in  Alabama. Most of the acts provide that foreign trusts operating  in violation of them shall be prohibited from doing business in  the states enacting the laws. Some of the laws prohibit corpora-  tions from holding trust certificates or stock.  The penalties for violation of the laws are most severe. The  United States law fixes the penalty at not exceeding $5000 fine,  or not exceeding one year's imprisonment, or both punishments.  In addition to this, property in transit shall be forfeited,  and any person who may be injured by a trust may recover  threefold the damages sustained, cost of suit, and attorney's fee.  The penalties in the various states are as follows: Oklahoma,  fine of $50 to $500; Alabama, $500 to $2000; Kentucky and  Louisiana, $500 to $5000; Illinois, $500 to $i5,000; Maine, $5  to $Io,ooo; Minnesota, $Ioo to $5000, and imprisonment for  one to ten years; Missouri, $Ioo per day; Nebraska, not exceed-  ing $Iooo, or imprisonment not exceeding six months; Tennes-  see, $250 for first offense, $500 for the second; Texas and Mis-  sissippi, $50 to $5000, and imprisonment for one to ten years,  and $50 for each additional day's offense. Officers and agents  are liable to the same penalty in Alabama, Kentucky, Louisiana,  Missouri and North Dakota, and to fines of $200 to $Iooo and  imprisonment, in Illinois and New Mexico. If assent to the  illegal agreement is not withdrawn within thirty days in Illinois,  Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, North Dakota and Nebraska, the cor-  poration shall forfeit its charter and all rights and franchises.  It is also provided in many cases that obligations to such com-  binations need not be regarded.  C    422 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY.  The laws in question have been uniformly upheld; but they  have, as a rule, simply harassed trade without accomplishing the  real end which they had in view. The very evident evils result-  ing from the concentration of power in the hands of a few  irresponsible trust managers, and the questionable methods by  which combinations have frequently been formed, have aroused  the public to action. Naturally then, with the prejudice against  monopolies deep-seated in the public consciousness, legislation  has been directed against the trust as such. It is easy to see  that the popular prejudice is, in part, unjustifiable; for, without  apologizing for many unscrupulous acts done by trusts, and  recognizing the danger from irresponsible power, it may still be  claimed that very great benefits arise from the economy of  management, and the adjustment of production to the needs of  consumption, made possible by wise and honorable trust manage-  ment. Add to this the fact that prohibitory efforts have thus  far proved abortive, and it becomes apparent that this, like a  great deal of other social legislation, has been based upon a very  imperfect knowledge of the facts involved.  Aside from this, the laws would fail of complete success in  destroying monoplies, because none of them would prevent a  single person from gaining control of an industry. With the  prevailing view of the liberty of the individual, it is necessary to  find a combination or conspiracy, or a corporation created by the  state, to attack. It is not that individual monopolists are not  regarded with suspicion; for the opposition to department stores  and similar enterprises is frequently pronounced. But these  have not yet been declared opposed to public policy; and a  single powerful manufacturer or merchant may freeze out all  competitors, yet without violating these anti-monopoly laws;  while an individual or a corporation that might try to buy out or  cooperate with competitors would be guilty of conspiracy. In  this respect we have fallen below the anti-monoply law of the  last parliament of James I.; for the old monopolists were indi-  viduals or individual companies, as the word itself indicates  (povos+?rwXC?ouat); and were in no sense trusts or cooperative asso-  C    \u001b[43m\u001b[1mANTI\u001b[0m- MONVOPOL Y LEGISLA TION. 423  ciations. It was admitted by the supreme court in the sugar  refineries casex that congress did not confine itself to the com-  mon law sense of the term \"as implying an exclusive control, by  authority, of one branch of industry without legal right of any  other person to interfere therewith by competition or otherwise,  but it includes engrossing as well, and covers controlling the  market by contracts securing the advantage of selling alone or  exclusively all, or some considerable portion, of a particular kind of  merchandise or commodity to the detriment of the public; and  that such contracts amount to that restraint of trade or com-  merce declared to be illegal.\" Evidently, then, if the laws aim  not -at the contract, but at the fact of irresponsible power,  they need some expansion.  The generally unserviceable character of the anti-trust legis-  lation must convince us that the question is no more settled than  it was before the legislators began to grapple with it-at least  existing laws do not settle it. As Von Halle says, \"More may  be expected finally from the decisions of the courts. Legal  judgments depend upon the conception of public policy; and as  this conception is subject to change, the law-creating action of  the courts is likely to change also. That this is possible, and  indeed is done by a process of quiet and natural progress, is the  very thing that constitutes the strength of the English common  law.\"'2  It may be that these anti-monopoly laws, futile although  most of them are, will serve a purpose in bringing into the  courts a problem that needs solution. A victory has undoubtedly  been gained in compelling the trusts to become incorporated,  and in making so much of their business public. Then, too, the  general recognition of the right of the state to prohibit that  which is opposed to public policy is likely to have most salutary  results. While, in the case under consideration, the exercise of  authority has been directed to the maintenance of conditions of  free competition, the policy itself is the reverse of laissezfaire.  I U. S. vs. Knight, I56 U. S., IO.  2\" Trusts,\" p. 109.  C    424 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY.  That old doctrine has worked out its own destruction. On the  one hand, powerful business interests will not let the weaker  ones alone; on the other, the state dares not let the powerful  combinations alone.  The right and duty of the state to preserve conditions con-  ducive to the general welfare being recognized, it may be  expected that mistakes and blunders made because of ignorance  of the real meaning of new industrial forces will be rectified as  those forces are better understood. The element due to dema-  gogism will also doubtless be sifted out. While it is assumed  that monopolies \"cannot be granted in such ordinary vocations  as can be left open to all to the common benefit,\" it has always  been recognized that they \"may be given as a matter of regula-  tion, where the business is such that the public interest can be  best subserved and protected by confiding it to one person, or  association of persons, who shall manage it exclusively.  This obligation to serve the public impartially would seem to be  an essential incident to any grant of a monopoly, since without  it, it would be impossible to justify the grant on public  grounds.\" I  Presumably, then, if it is found that a trust can best sub-  serve the interests of the public, and can be made to serve it  impartially, there is nothing in the spirit of our laws to prevent  a change of attitude toward such combinations. The right of a  state to pass laws of this sort is based upon its general right of  police regulation. This right is abridged somewhat by the con-  stitutional provision that a state cannot interfere with interstate  commerce; but a decision of the Supreme Court, rendered  January 2I, I895, in the case above referred to against the con-  solidated Philadelphia and New Jersey sugar refineries, reserves  to the United States the right to regulate trade and com-  merce only, and leaves the regulation of the acquisition and  control of property to the states. Under these circumstances  the responsibility is thrown upon the -states. With the further  progress of the co6perative movement, which is sure to come,  X Cooley, \" Constitutional Law,\" p. 247.  C    \u001b[43m\u001b[1mANTI\u001b[0m- MONOPOLY LEGISLA TION. 425  we may expect further legislation becoming more and more  rational; but the decision of the individual cases, with due  allowance for time and place and in harmony with the principles  of common law -which means that abandonment by a privileged  party of its duty to the public will not be tolerated -will do  more to solve the problem than legislation of the kind we have  been considering.  The solution will probably be something like that suggested  by Von Halle in his conclusion: \"It is my belief that the  future belongs neither to the prophets of individualism, nor to  the ideals of the social-democrats. Its next phases belong to social  reorganization. And the probability is that this will show a cor-  porate character, and will be sustained and controlled by public  J. D.
