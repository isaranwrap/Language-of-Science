      " The central problem is one of the unreliabil-\n",

      " a group of cases in which an error has been\n",
      " made. The interviewer accidentally checks the\n",
      " wrong box, the respondent misunderstands the\n",
      " question, the punch-derk punches the wrong\n",
      " number, etc. Let us assume for purposes of illus-\n",
      " tration that this kind of error occurs in 10 per\n",
      " cent of the cases and that it is random and so\n",
      " equally likely to happen for any case included\n",
      " in the study. If we are dealing with an attitude\n",
      " whose distribution in the population is uneven,\n",
      " the situation may be seen in Table 1.\n",
      "\n",
      " In this table we see that among the 400 cases\n",
      " in the sample who are really \"for\" the issue, 40\n",
      " will be erroneously dassified as \"against\" and\n",
      " will be added to the \"against\" total. At the\n",
      " same time, 10 of the 100 people who are really\n",
      " \"against\" will be classified as \"for.\" Thus the\n",
      " loss of the larger group is numerically greater,\n",
      " being only partially compensated for by errors\n",
      " in the opposite direction, and the distribution of\n",
      " opinion as measured is somewhat more evenly\n",
      " divided than it would be if the measurement\n",
      " were free of error. The limiting case of this proc-\n",
      " ess would occur if the measurement had no re-\n",
      " liability at all (so that every case was dassified\n",
      " as though by tossing a coin), when the measured\n",
      " distribution would show a 50-50 split, no matter\n",
      " what the \"true\" division of opinion might be.\n",
      " Now let us assume that we remeasure these\n",
      "\n",
      " cases, as is done in a panel study. To begin with,\n",
      " for the sake of simplicity, let us assume, further,\n",
      " that errors will not be made in the same case\n",

      " Upon remeasurement, they should revert to\n",
      " their proper place, the \"against\" column. But 10\n",
      " new errors will occur to take their place. That is,\n",
      " there will be 10 new people who are actually\n",
      " \"against\" who will now be measured as \"for.\"\n",
      " Similarly, the 40 cases who were erroneously\n",

      " would be as shown in Table 2. The distribution\n",

      " Occasionally, of course, an error will occur\n",

      " These 5 cases will take the place of 5 of the new\n",
      " errors in the second measurement. Thus, in fact,\n",
      " only 45 cases, rather than 50, will move each\n",

      " remains the same upon the second measurement\n",
