This study combines data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics with data from four cen-
suses to examine the effects of foreign-born populations in the immediate and surrounding
neighborhoods of residence on native-born black and white householders’ residential mobil-
ity decisions. We find that the likelihood of out-mobility for native householders is signifi-
cantly and positively associated with the relative size of, and increases in, the immigrant
population in a neighborhood. Consistent with theoretical arguments related to the distance
dependence of mobility, large concentrations of immigrants in surrounding areas reduce
native out-mobility, presumably by reducing the attractiveness of the most likely mobility
destinations. A sizable share of local immigration effects can be explained by the mobility-
related characteristics of native-born individuals living in immigrant-populated areas, but
the racial composition of a neighborhood (for native whites) and local housing-market condi-
tions (for native blacks) are also important mediating factors. We discuss the implications of
these patterns for processes of neighborhood change and broader patterns of residential
segregation.
The increasing diversity of metropolitan pop-
ulations and declining levels of segregation
between many racial and ethnic groups
have spurred considerable hope for increased
residential equity in the United States (e.g.,
Glaeser and Vigdor 2003; Iceland 2009).
Heightened immigration during the past sev-
eral decades has dramatically increased lev-
els of diversity in most metropolitan areas
(Fasenfest, Booza, and Metzger 2006; Fong
and Shibuya 2005), corresponding with
increases in intergroup exposure and declines
in multigroup segregation (Timberlake and
Iceland 2007). Even average levels of
segregation between blacks and whites—
historically the most stubborn form of
troubling that Latinos’ and Asians’ residential
segregation from the non-Hispanic white
majority has remained stable, or according to
some measures has increased, since 1980 (Ice-
land 2009; Logan 2001). And, while residen-
tial contact with all other groups has increased
for African Americans, Latinos and Asians
remain at least as segregated from African
Americans as from whites.'! Such trends led
Timberlake and Iceland (2007) to predict
that Latinos will soon overtake blacks as the
most segregated group from whites.

To a considerable extent, the increasing
residential isolation of Asians and Latinos—
groups that make up the largest shares of the
immigrant population (Grieco 2010)—
represents a piling up of recent arrivals in estab-
lished co-ethnic neighborhoods. As a result, the
continual inflow of new immigrants tends to
bolster overall segregation levels for Latinos
and Asians (Iceland 2009; Iceland and Nelson
2008; Iceland and Scopilliti 2008), even as their
settlement patterns shift away from traditional
metropolitan entry points toward a wider range
of communities (Lichter and Johnson 2009;
McConnell 2008; Singer 2009).

While the settlement patterns of immi-
grants themselves are important, native-born
residents’ decisions to remain in diversifying
neighborhoods or to flee in the face of grow-
ing immigrant concentrations are just as cru-
cial in determining the trajectory of residential
integration. The effects of immigrant concen-
trations on native-born populations’ inter-
regional migration have been the subject of
extensive debate (e.g., Borjas 2006; Ellis and
Wright 1998; Frey 1995; Kritz and Gurak
2001; White and Liang 1998; Wright, Ellis,
and Reibel 1997), but the effects on more
local mobility decisions have received scant
attention. This is an important omission given
that shorter-distance moves are far more com-
mon than long-distance moves, and they are
crucial to understanding segregation across
neighborhoods.

In this article, we assess how concentra-
tions of foreign-born populations in the
immediate neighborhood of residence and
Research on the effects of immigration on
U.S. spatial structures focuses primarily on
tests of popular theoretical arguments related
to immigrant groups’ ability to assimilate
spatially into neighborhoods occupied by
native-born populations (for reviews, see
Charles 2006; Iceland 2009; Rosenbaum
and Friedman 2007). Far less attention has
been paid to how immigrant settlement pat-
terns affect inter-neighborhood mobility pro-
cesses of the native born, behaviors that
likely have equally important effects on over-
all patterns of neighborhood change and seg-
regation. Currently, information on these
processes must be gleaned from aggregate-
level studies documenting the effects of
Asian or Latino populations in general—not
immigrants specifically—on neighborhood
turnover (e.g., Denton and Massey 1991),
studies of inter-group dynamics within spe-
cific neighborhoods of single cities (e.g.,
Wilson and Taub 2006), or studies of native
reactions to immigrants in countries outside
the United States (e.g., Brama 2006; Ray,
Halseth, and Johnson 1997).

By contrast, scholars have paid consider-
able attention to the effects of immigrant
concentrations and change on natives’ longer-
distance migration decisions. In some early
work, Frey (1995; Frey and Liaw 1998)
argued that the United States is being trans-
formed by a process of regional population
redistribution in which native-born popula-
tions are increasingly moving away from met-
ropolitan areas with large and growing con-
centrations of immigrants, creating a kind of
regional “‘balkanization,” replete with diver-
gent political interests, social conditions, and
economic trajectories. Frey’s conclusions
and terminology are controversial (see Ellis
and Wright 1998), and subsequent research
shows mixed evidence of immigration effects
on inter-regional migration (e.g., Card 2001;
Card and DiNardo 2000; Kritz and Gurak
2001; White and Liang 1998; Wright et al.
1997). However, this research, along with
studies on residential mobility and segrega-
tion, provides theoretical reasons to believe
that the type of demographic balkanization
posited by Frey may be underway at a lower
level of aggregation, with concentrations of
immigrants in the neighborhood of residence
affecting native-born residents’ out-mobility.

One possibility, according to a general
sociodemographic composition argument, is
that any association between local immigrant
concentrations and native out-mobility reflects
the composition of native-born populations in
neighborhoods in which immigrants tend to
settle. Specifically, if immigrant populations
concentrate in areas in which native-born res-
idents have lifecycle characteristics (e.g.,
young, unmarried, and childless) or housing
conditions (e.g., short-term residents or non-
owners) conducive to mobility, then areas
with large or growing concentrations of for-
eign-born residents will exhibit relatively
high levels of native out-migration. According
to this argument, this association will be
reduced by controlling for native households’
sociodemographic characteristics. While such
a finding would not diminish the importance
of native out-migration flows in processes of
neighborhood change and segregation, it
would indicate that the connection of this
out-migration to local concentrations of immi-
grants is simply coincidental with micro-level
processes.

Three other competing theoretical argu-
ments suggest that immigrant concentrations
have an impact on native out-mobility but
point to different mediating factors. First, the
ethnic flight thesis suggests that large or
growing concentrations of foreign-born resi-
dents in a neighborhood might spur native
out-mobility by affecting a neighborhood’s
racial and ethnic composition (Saiz and
Wachter 2006). Consistent with this argu-
ment, Clark and Blue (2004) argue that high
levels of segregation within immigrant gate-
way cities reflect the preferences of members
of most groups to cluster with co-ethnics.
While racial attitudes expressed by white sur-
vey respondents reflect increasing tolerance,
the latest survey results confirm that whites
remain reluctant to live in even moderately
integrated neighborhoods (Charles 2006;
Krysan 2002a) and tend to rate integrated
neighborhoods as substantially less desirable
than predominantly white neighborhoods
(Krysan 2002b; Krysan and Bader 2007).
Much of this research on neighborhood resi-
dential preferences focuses on whites’ aver-
sion to black neighbors, but there is also evi-
dence that whites have limited tolerance for
living near Asians and Latinos (Charles
2006; Clark 2009). The limited research on
the topic confirms that large concentrations
of minorities significantly increase white
householders’ likelihood of moving to a differ-
ent neighborhood (Crowder 2000; Crowder
and South 2008).

In comparison to whites, black survey
respondents express stronger tolerance for
integration (Charles 2006; Krysan and Bader
2007; Krysan and Farley 2002). However,
negative attitudes toward Asians and Latinos
are also fairly common among black survey
respondents (Charles 2006), and ethnographic
research often points to animosity on the part
of African Americans toward immigrant
groups who settle in their neighborhoods
(e.g., Johnson, Farrell, and Guinn 1999;
Marrow 2008; Wilson and Taub 2006). The
ethnic flight argument thus highlights the
racial and ethnic diversity of the foreign-
born populations and suggests that high con-
centrations of immigrants in a neighborhood
may reduce residential satisfaction and
increase the likelihood of out-mobility for
black and white native-born residents by
increasing the share of “undesirable” racial
and ethnic groups and reducing the relative
share of own-race neighbors. According to
this thesis, controlling for the concentration
of racial and ethnic out-groups in a neighbor-
hood will attenuate any association between
local immigrant concentrations and native
out-mobility.

An alternative theoretical argument, the
socioeconomic context thesis, suggests that
reactions to non-racial socioeconomic condi-
tions, not an aversion to particular racial or
ethnic groups, are the primary drivers of pop-
ulation loss and neighborhood change (Harris
1999; Keating 1994; Taub, Taylor, and
Dunham 1984). According to this argument,
large concentrations of immigrants in a neigh-
borhood may spur native out-mobility by
undermining the neighborhood’s socioeco-
nomic quality. Because immigrants tend to
have lower levels of education and are more
likely than the native born to live in poverty
(DeJong and Madamba 2001; White and Glick
2009), high concentrations of immigrants are
likely to be associated with lower average
income levels in a neighborhood. To the extent
that income levels are linked to the physical
condition of a neighborhood, local levels of
crime, and the quality of services and other
valuable amenities (Logan and Alba 1993), res-
idential satisfaction may be undermined, and
the likelihood of residential out-mobility
enhanced, for native-born householders with
large numbers of foreign-born neighbors.
According to this argument, controls for neigh-
borhood income levels should diminish the link
between local concentrations of immigrants
and native out-mobility.

Finally, the housing competition model sug-
gests that large and growing concentrations of
immigrants might affect native-born residents’
out-mobility by engendering fundamental
changes in local housing-market conditions
(Ley 2007; Ley and Tutchener 2001). Specifi-
cally, increases in the concentration of immi-
grants may drive up the cost of housing in an
area, which, in turn, might push native resi-
dents out of the neighborhood. In a related
way, the concentration of immigrants in
a neighborhood may be associated with other
local housing-market conditions, including
rates of homeownership and new construction,
that may correspond with residential satisfac-
tion among native-born residents. These argu-
ments, which parallel theoretical models focus-
ing on job competition as a primary driver of
the link between immigrant concentrations
and native inter-regional mobility (e.g., Frey
1995; Walker, Ellis, and Barff 1992; White
and Liang 1998), suggest that local housing-
market conditions represent an important
mediating factor in native-born residents’
mobility reactions to local immigrant concen-
trations. Indeed, Wilson and Taub (2006) high-
light variations in the competition for housing
as a central factor to explain differential inter-
group dynamics and trajectories of neighbor-
hood change in the face of increasing immi-
grant concentrations.

Although they point to different explanatory
mechanisms, each of these theoretical argu-
ments suggests that large and growing concen-
trations of immigrants in one’s immediate
neighborhood will increase the likelihood of
out-mobility for individual native-born resi-
dents. However, it is likely that immigrant con-
centrations in nearby neighborhoods will also
affect native mobility decisions. Following
a simple native flight argument, large immigrant
concentrations in extralocal areas may signal to
native-born residents the impending influx of
immigrants into their own neighborhoods,
prompting them to leave the neighborhood.

Existing theory and research on residential
mobility processes offer an alternative hypoth-
esis: extralocal immigrant concentrations
might reduce the likelihood of native out-
mobility. According to this literature, because
We explore these theoretical arguments using
data from the 1968 through 2005 waves of
the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID
2010) linked to contextual data drawn from
the U.S. Census. The PSID is a well-known
longitudinal survey of U.S. residents and
their families that began in 1968 with
approximately 5,000 families. Members of
panel families were interviewed annually
between 1968 and 1997 and every two years
thereafter. New families have been added to
the panel as children and other members of
original panel families formed their own
households. The longitudinal nature of the
PSID data makes it possible to assess pro-
spectively the migration behavior of individ-
ual householders, and the data contain rich
information on a variety of individual- and
household-level characteristics that are
known to influence residential mobility deci-
sions, thereby improving our ability to isolate
the effects of foreign-born concentrations on
these behaviors.

The availability of restricted-access
Geocode Match Files, which link the records
of individual respondents to census codes
describing their place of residence at each
interview, also makes the PSID well suited
for our purposes. These supplemental data
allow us to trace the migration of PSID
respondents across neighborhoods between
successive interviews and to attach detailed
census data about the neighborhoods occupied
by these respondents at each annual interview.
The PSID Geocode data also allow us to iden-
tify the conditions of the extralocal neighbor-
hoods—those neighborhoods that are in close
proximity to the tract in which each PSID
respondent resided at each annual interview.
We use spatial analytic tools to determine
the physical proximity of the census tract of
residence to all other census tracts in the coun-
try. By attaching information on the character-
istics of surrounding tracts, we are able to con-
struct reliable measures of local and extralocal
neighborhood conditions for PSID respond-
ents at each interview.

In this study, we follow much of the prior
work in this area (e.g., Crowder and South
2008; Massey, Gross, and Shibuya 1994) by
using census tracts to represent neighborhoods
in defining local and extralocal neighborhood
conditions. Although census tracts are imper-
fect operationalizations of neighborhoods
(Tienda 1991), they undoubtedly come closest
of any commonly available spatial entity in
approximating the usual conception of a neigh-
borhood (Jargowsky 1997; White 1987). Fur-
thermore, as of the 2000 Census, census tracts
are designated for the entire United States,
providing the basis for characterizing neigh-
borhoods consistently for all PSID respond-
ents. Potential problems associated with
changes in tract boundaries across decennial
censuses are mitigated by our use of the
Neighborhood Change Database (NCDB),
constructed through a collaboration of Geo-
Lytics Corporation and the Urban Institute
(GeoLytics 2006). We use the NCDB’s data
on tracts from the 1970, 1980, 1990, and
2000 Censuses and use linear interpolation/
extrapolation, with adjacent census years as
endpoints, to estimate values for all tract char-
acteristics in non-census years.
Our effective sample for this analysis con-
sists of 16,516 native-born, non-Latino white
and non-Latino black heads of PSID house-
holds who were interviewed between 1968
(the first year of the PSID data collection)
and 2005. Given the original structure of the
PSID panel, based on a sample of families
drawn in 1968, the numbers of native-bom
members of non-white, non-black groups are
too small to sustain a separate analysis.
Because most residential moves are undertaken
by families, a household head’s decision to
move (or a decision made jointly by the family)
perforce means a move by other family mem-
bers. The focus only on household heads allows
us to avoid counting as unique and distinct
moves made by members of the same family
(e.g., children or spouses). At the same time,
moves by family members who were not the
household head at one interview but became
the head of a household by the subsequent
interview (e.g., a child leaving the parental
home or an ex-spouse establishing a new resi-
dence) are included in our effective sample.

We take advantage of the longitudinal
nature of the PSID data and the fact that
tract-coded residential addresses are avail-
able for PSID respondents at each interview
by segmenting each respondent’s data
record into a series of person-period obser-
vations, with each observation referring to
a two-year period between PSID interviews.
Although it is possible to define annual
mobility intervals for most years of the
PSID, the use of a two-year interval is
necessitated by the adoption of a biennial
interview schedule in the PSID after
1997 On average, individual household
heads in the sample contribute just fewer
than 9.4 person-period observations for
a total sample size of 154,848 person-period
observations. We use logistic regression to
examine the additive and interactive effects
of local and extralocal neighborhood condi-
tions and individual-level characteristics on
the odds of moving to a different census
tract between interviews. Because the same
PSID respondent can contribute more than
Explanatory variables. The primary
explanatory variables refer to the level of,
and change in, the immigrant concentration
in and around the tract of residence at the
beginning of the migration interval. We mea-
sure local immigrant concentration by the
percentage of the population in the tract of
residence made up of individuals born outside
the United States. We measure change in the
immigrant concentration as the absolute dif-
ference between the percent foreign born in
the year of observation and the percent foreign
born in the tract five years prior to the obser-
vation year; both are estimated through linear
interpolation for non-census years.

We characterize immigrant concentration
in extralocal neighborhoods as the distance-
weighted average percent foreign born in sur-
rounding tracts. To create these measures, we
use a spatial weights matrix that specifies, for
each tract, the presumed existence and magni-
tude of effects of conditions in other tracts
on outcomes among individuals originating
in a particular tract of origin. Following
Downey’s (2006) argument that spatial depen-
dence tends to decline with distance, we
employ a spatial-weighting strategy in which
the influence of conditions in an extralocal
area on individual mobility decisions is
assumed to be inversely related to the distance
of the extralocal tract from an individual’s
tract of residence. Specifically, under this dis-
tance-decay strategy, the elements of the spa-
tial weights matrix are defined as wy = Vd,
where dj is the geographic distance between
the centroid of the tract of residence i,
and the centroid of the extralocal tract j.*
Given the implausibility that the demographic
characteristics of every tract in the nation
directly affect the decisions of residents of
all other tracts, we constrain to zero the influ-
ence of tracts that are more than 100 miles
away from the focal tract. Even without this
constraint, spatial weights determined by
inverse distance are quite small beyond dis-
tances of about 10 miles.> The weights matrix
is row standardized so that the elements of
each row sum to one and the resulting extralo-
cal measure of immigrant concentration can
be easily interpreted as the distance-weighted
average percent foreign born in surrounding
tracts (Anselin 2001).

We consider a variety of other character-
istics of the native-born sample members,
their families, and their neighborhoods in
order to isolate the effects of immigrant
concentrations on native out-mobility and
to test competing theoretical explanations
for this association. Micro-level predictors
of mobility used to test the sociodemo-
graphic composition thesis include age
and, to capture the non-monotonic depen-
dence of migration on age (Long 1988),
age squared. Householder’s sex is captured
as a dummy variable scored 1 for females,
and marital status takes a value of 1 for
respondents who were married or perma-
nently co-habiting. The effect of children
is tapped with a dummy variable taking
a value of 1 for individuals living in a family
with any members under 18 years of age.
We also control for householder’s educa-
tion, measured by years of school com-
pleted, and the total family taxable income,
measured in thousands of constant 2000
dollars. We code home ownership as 1 for
respondents in an owner-occupied housing
unit; we measure household crowding by
the number of persons per room; and length
of residence takes a value of 1 for respond-
ents who had lived in their homes for at least
three years. All of these variables, except
gender, are considered time-varying and
refer to conditions at the beginning of the
mobility interval. We include the year of
observation to account for temporal changes
in inter-neighborhood migration.

We present models with controls for a vari-
ety of characteristics of the tract of origin to
test the relative influence of mediating mech-
anisms implicated in competing theoretical
models. To test the ethnic flight thesis that
mobility away from immigrant populations
reflects a reaction to local racial conditions,
we consider the percentage of a tract’s popu-
lation made up of residents with a different
race than the respondent (i.e., percent other
than non-Hispanic white for white respond-
ents and percent other than non-Hispanic
black for black respondents). The socioeco-
nomic context thesis suggests that native-
born residents are more responsive to condi-
tions related to a neighborhood’s economic
characteristics, an argument we test by con-
trolling for the average income (adjusted to
1000s of year 2000 dollars) of all families in
the tract of origin. To test the housing compe-
tition model, we control for several measures
of the local housing market that may affect
mobility decisions and may be associated
with the size and change in the local concen-
tration of immigrants. We measure housing
costs and demand primarily with the average
rent for renter-occupied housing in a tract®
and the percent of housing units that were
vacant at the beginning of the observation
period. We also control for level of homeown-
ership (the percentage of households in the
tract of residence that are owner occupied)
and age of the housing stock (the percentage
of housing in a tract built in the preceding
10 years) to better isolate the effects of local
immigrant concentrations.
We begin with a basic description of native-
born households’ residential exposure to
immigrants during the study period. At the
beginning of the average observation period,
PSID householders in our sample resided in
tracts in which just fewer than 5.5 percent
of residents were foreign born (see Table
Al in the Appendix for pooled and race-
specific statistics). However, this residential
exposure changed considerably over the
years of the PSID survey. As Figure 1 shows,
there has been a fairly steady increase in the
concentration of immigrants in the tracts
occupied by PSID householders. The per-
centage foreign born as of the beginning of
the biennial interview periods increased
from about 3.9 for observations in 1968 to
7.6 in 2005. This, of course, is consistent
with the general increase in the foreign-
born population in the country as a whole
and points to increasing levels of residential
exposure between native- and foreign-born
households.

It is important to note, however, that the
increasing concentration of immigrants in
natives’ neighborhoods has been much less
pronounced than increases in foreign-born
representation elsewhere. For example, Figure
1 also shows a steady increase in the concen-
tration of immigrants in metropolitan areas
represented by PSID householders located in
metropolitan areas; this increase has been sub-
stantially stronger than the increase in immi-
grant concentrations in tracts occupied by
native-born PSID respondents.’ These num-
bers indicate that native-born households
have been somewhat shielded from the more
general potential residential repercussions of
increasing immigrant concentrations. Native-
born households tend to find themselves in
neighborhoods in which foreign-born popula-
tions are underrepresented relative to metro-
politan concentrations. These numbers also
Table 1 presents coefficients from a logistic
regression analysis predicting the log-odds
of moving to a different tract during the
two-year migration interval for native-born
white and black PSID householders. Model
1 includes the relative size of the foreign-
born population in the tract occupied by
a householder at the beginning of the inter-
val. The logit coefficient (b = .014) for this
variable is positive and statistically signifi-
cant (p < .001), indicating that the likelihood
of leaving a neighborhood increases for
native-born residents as the share of immi-
grants in the neighborhood increases. Specif-
ically, a one-standard-deviation increase in
the tract percent foreign born increases the
odds of out-mobility by 11.2 percent
fe("#"7.65) = 1.112],

Model 2 of Table 1 adds measures of two
other dimensions of immigrant population
dynamics facing native householders: changes
in immigrant concentrations in the tract of res-
idence occurring during the five-year period
leading up to each interval, and the spatially
weighted average concentration of immigrants
in surrounding neighborhoods. The coefficient
— Percent Foreign-Born in Tract of Residence

--- Percent Foreign-Born in MSA of Residence
associated with neighborhood out-mobility
among native householders.® This negative
effect is consistent with past research and the-
oretical arguments highlighting the distance-
dependence of migration. Because most geo-
graphic moves take place over a relatively
short distance, unfavorable conditions in
nearby areas will tend to reduce the likelihood
of out-migration by convincing householders
that the most likely available neighborhood
alternatives are relatively unattractive.” In this
way, consideration of the relative concentra-
tion of immigrants appears to extend beyond
the immediate neighborhood to surrounding
areas as well. Native householders tend to
move if their neighborhood contains a large
share of immigrants, but this tendency is offset
if surrounding neighborhoods also have high
concentrations of foreign-born neighbors.
Controlling for the size of the immigrant
population in extralocal areas also has the
effect of increasing the coefficient for the
local neighborhood immigrant concentra-
tion (b = .023) relative to the coefficient in
Model 1 (6 = .014). This suppression stems
from the fairly strong positive association
between local and extralocal immigrant
concentrations, with neighborhoods of

2004). Specifically, the model includes
coefficients for the year of observation
(measured as the number of years since
1968, the first year of PSID data) and prod-
uct terms representing interactions between
this year variable and each of the three
dimensions of immigrant population dynam-
ics: percent foreign born in the tract of
origin, changes in this percentage in the pre-
ceding five years, and immigrant concentra-
tions in extralocal neighborhoods. The neg-
ative, statistically significant coefficient for
year of observation reflects the general
decline in residential mobility (Fischer
2002). However, and more important for
our purposes, there is no evidence that the
effects of immigrant populations on the like-
lihood of out-mobility among native-born
members of our sample changed over time;
the coefficients for all three interaction
terms are close to zero and far from statisti-
cally significant. While native-born resi-
dents experienced increased residential
exposure to immigrant populations, the
out-mobility response to these populations
remained relatively unchanged since the
late 1960s; mobility effects of recent
changes in local immigrant concentrations
and foreign-born representation in extralo-
cal areas have also not changed much.!!
Coefficients in Model 4 also indicate that
the tendency to move away from larger
immigrant populations holds for both black
and white native-born householders. Consis-
tent with published research (e.g., Crowder
and South 2005; South and Deane 1993),
the likelihood of mobility is higher for black
than for white householders, as indicated by
the positive and statistically significant
coefficient for black race (b = .234). How-
ever, the coefficient for the interaction
between black race and percent foreign
born in a tract (b = —.0001) is very small
and falls short of statistical significance.
Native-born residents of both races appear
to be about equally responsive to the size
of the immigrant population in a neighbor-
hood. There is also no evidence that the
effect of immigrant concentrations in extra-
local areas varies significantly by race.
However, as indicated by the statistically
significant negative interaction between black
race and level of recent change in local neigh-
borhood immigrant concentration (b =
—.040), the effect of changing immigrant con-
centrations on out-mobility is significantly
stronger among white than among black
households. In fact, combining the main coef-
ficient for change in immigrant concentrations
and its interaction with race shows that chang-
ing neighborhood conditions have essentially
no effect on mobility decisions for black
householders [.044 + (—.040) = .004]. From
the perspective of conventional theoretical
models, the stronger effect among whites
than among blacks appears to suggest that
increasing immigrant concentrations simply
generate more residential dissatisfaction
among white householders. However, in the
context of racially stratified housing markets,
black householders may simply have fewer
opportunities to act on any residential dissatis-
faction generated by growing immigrant pop-
ulations (Crowder 2001).

Overall, the analysis in Table 1 suggests
that native-born residents’ out-mobility tends
to be higher in neighborhoods containing
large shares of immigrants. By itself, this
association has important implications for pro-
cesses of neighborhood change and the influ-
ence of native mobility decisions on the main-
tenance of immigrant-native segregation.’
However, this tendency of the native born
to exit areas with larger foreign-born con-
centrations does not necessarily reflect
a direct aversion to residence near immi-
grants; it may reflect the influence of other
contextual conditions or the composition
of native populations in areas with large
numbers of immigrants. In the remaining
analyses, we test competing theoretical
arguments offered to explain these gross
effects of local immigrant concentrations.

Tables 2 and 3 present analyses of mobility
for native-born black and white householders,
respectively. These racially disaggregated
models are motivated not only by evidence
of at least modest racial differences in
responses to local immigrant dynamics, but
by the possibility of racial differences in the
dynamics underlying these mobility pro-
cesses. Existing literature points to important
racial differences in residential search pro-
cesses (Krysan 2008; Krysan and Bader
2009) and mobility outcomes (Crowder and
South 2005) and suggests that black house-
holders are significantly less likely than
whites to convert dissatisfaction with local
neighborhood conditions into actual mobility
(Crowder 2001; South and Deane 1993). In
combination with observed racial differences
in residential preferences (Charles 2006),
this evidence suggests that the mechanisms
through which local immigrant concentrations
affect mobility decisions might differ by race.

As a baseline for our test of competing the-
oretical explanations, Model 1 of Table 2
includes only terms for local and extralocal
immigrant conditions facing native-born black
householders. As in the pooled model, results
in Model 1 show that, among African Ameri-
can householders, the likelihood of out-mobil-
ity increases with the representation of immi-
grants in the immediate neighborhood of
residence at the beginning of the observation
period; a one-standard-deviation increase in
the relative size of the immigrant population
is associated with a 22 percent increase in
the odds of leaving a neighborhood
[e025°8-067) = 1.223]. Also consistent with
results in Table 1, the coefficient for recent
changes in the size of the immigrant represen-
tation is positive but not statistically signifi-
cant. By contrast, however, the distance-
weighted average level of immigrant concen-
tration in surrounding tracts is negatively and
significantly associated with neighborhood
out-mobility among black householders.

Model 2 of Table 2 includes controls for
a wide range of individual- and household-
level determinants of mobility and is designed
to test the sociodemographic composition
argument that the heightened likelihood of
out-mobility from immigrant-populated
neighborhoods is simply reflective of the
fact that black householders residing in
these areas possess characteristics that
increase their propensity for mobility more
generally. Effects of these controls are con-
sistent with results of past research: the like-
lihood of out-mobility decreases (but at
a declining pace) with age and is lower for
married householders and those with chil-
dren. Net of other factors, higher levels of
income are associated with a greater likeli-
hood of residential mobility. Homeowner-
ship and longer-term residence decrease
the likelihood of residential mobility, but
living in more crowded housing increases
this likelihood.
Most important, controlling for these
micro-level mobility predictors accounts for
a sizeable share of the association between
local immigrant concentrations and inter-tract
mobility among black householders, with the
coefficient for this variable reduced by almost
half (from .025 to .013) between Models 1
and 2. Consistent with the compositional
explanation for the effects of immigrant con-
centrations, part of black households’ elevated
mobility away from high immigrant concen-
trations is due, not to a direct reaction to living
near immigrants, but to the fact that black res-
idents of areas with large immigrant popula-
tions have other characteristics conducive to
mobility. Housing characteristics are espe-
cially important here: separate models (not
shown here) in which micro-level variables
are added sequentially indicate that controls
for homeownership and length of residence
are primarily responsible for the attenuation
of the local immigrant effect between Models
1 and 2. Among black householders, those
who do not own their home and those who
had moved within the preceding three years
tend to live in areas with the highest immi-
grant concentrations. These short-term resi-
dents and renters are more likely than lon-
ger-term residents and homeowners to move,
accounting for part of the positive association
between local immigrant concentrations and
residential mobility. By contrast, these
micro-level influences suppress the associa-
tion between growing foreign-born popula-
tions and out-mobility for native blacks. Con-
trolling for these variables in Model 2 reveals
a positive and statistically significant coeffi-
cient indicative of a higher likelihood of out-
mobility from areas experiencing greater
increases in immigrant concentration.

The remaining models in Table 2 test com-
peting theoretical arguments regarding the
mechanisms through which local immigrant
concentrations affect native black out-
mobility. Consistent with an ethnic flight
argument, coefficients in Model 3 of Table 2
indicate that part of the residual influence of
local immigrant concentrations _ reflects

association with housing-market conditions
that increase the likelihood of black out-
mobility. Two characteristics of the local
housing market are especially important in
this regard: the concentration of homeowners
is negatively associated with the concentration
of immigrants and the likelihood of out-
mobility for native black householders; and
average rent costs tend to be higher in areas
with large immigrant populations and are pos-
itively associated with out-mobility for black
householders. Separate models (not shown
here) indicate that controlling for these two
variables alone accounts for the attenuation
of the local foreign-born effect across the final
model of Table 2. The mediating effect of
local rents provides some support for the com-
petition argument that large concentrations of
immigrants transform the local housing mar-
ket in ways that price some black household-
ers out of the market. By contrast, the positive
effect of changes in immigrant concentration
on residential mobility for blacks remains sta-
tistically significant despite the introduction of
neighborhood-level control variables and
actually increases in strength in Model 5. Sim-
ilarly, higher concentrations of immigrants in
nearby neighborhoods continue to discourage
black out-migration, despite the inclusion of
control variables.

Results of regression analyses of out-
mobility for native-born white householders
show dynamics similar to those observed for
blacks but that differ in potentially important
ways. Table 3 presents these results. As is
true for black householders, the likelihood of
neighborhood out-mobility is positively asso-
ciated with the concentration of foreign-born
residents in a neighborhood. Model 1 shows
the negative effect of extralocal conditions
that partially suppress the effects of local
immigrant concentrations,? and a net positive
effect of changing local concentrations of
immigrants that is even stronger among
whites than among blacks.

The remaining models in Table 3 investi-
gate possible explanations for the elevated
white out-mobility away from large immi-
grant concentrations. Model 2 introduces the
full slate of individual- and household-level
mobility controls. Consistent with the results
for black householders, these variables have
important influences on native-born whites’
mobility decisions and greatly attenuate the
effects of the local immigrant concentration.
Specifically, the coefficient for local immi-
grant concentration in a neighborhood is
reduced to about 40 percent of its original
size (from .027 to .011) with the introduction
of these controls. This lends considerable sup-
port to the compositional explanation of white
mobility behavior. However, the effect of
percent immigrant remains positive and sig-
nificant even after controlling for these fac-
tors. Moreover, controlling for these addi-
tional variables does nothing to account for
the significant association between residential
out-mobility and recent changes in immigrant
concentrations; the coefficient for this variable
actually increases (from .043 to .050) between
Models 1 and 2. Even after controlling for the
influence of key micro-level mobility determi-
nants, the likelihood of white out-mobility
increases significantly with both the size of
the local immigrant population and recent
increases in this foreign-born representation.

Results presented in Model 3 indicate that
at least part of these effects of local immigrant
concentrations and change can be attributed to
the effects of neighborhood racial composi-
tion. As with black householders, and consis-
tent with past research (Crowder and South
2008), larger concentrations of neighbors of
a different race increase the likelihood of
out-mobility for white householders, and this
effect holds after controlling for a tract’s
socioeconomic condition (see Model 4). How-
ever, this effect is considerably larger for
white than for black householders (compare
coefficients in Model 3 of Table 3 with Model
3 in Table 2)'* and plays a more substantial
role in attenuating the effect of local immi-
grant concentrations. Specifically, control-
ling for the racial composition of a tract
reduces the coefficient for relative size of
the immigrant population by almost half
(from .011 to .006) and reduces the coeffi-
cient to statistical nonsignificance (p =
.096). A sizable part of the link between
white out-mobility and the size of the for-
eign-born population thus appears to be
a function of the associated concentration
of non-whites in a neighborhood.'* By con-
trast, the effect of changes in immigrant
concentration on whites’ residential mobil-
ity changes only modestly with the control
for relative presence of non-whites in
a neighborhood, declining by about 14 per-
cent (from .050 to .043) between Models 2
and 3 of Table 3.
Finally, the coefficients in Model 5 of
Table 3 indicate that among native-born
whites, the likelihood of out-mobility
increases with rents in a neighborhood and
declines with the level of homeownership in
an area. Both of these tract characteristics
are also correlated with recent changes in
the immigrant population; rents are higher
(Pearson r = .155), and homeownership lower
(Pearson r = —.195) in areas experiencing
more rapid growth in immigrant representa-
tion. As a result, controlling for these local
housing-market conditions helps explain
part of the association between immigrant
growth and white out-mobility; the coeffi-
cient for this change variable declines by
about 12 percent (from .043 to .038)
between Models 4 and 5. Again, this pro-
vides some support for the argument that
growing immigrant populations alter local
housing conditions in a way that spurs out-
mobility among whites. However, the
mobility-inducing effect of recent increases
in immigrant concentrations and the likeli-
hood of out-mobility remain substantial
and statistically significant even with con-
trols for these housing-market conditions.
1960s, even as the size and diversity of the
immigrant population has changed dramati-
cally. Net of the effect of the size of the
immigrant population in a neighborhood,
recent increases in the foreign-born repre-
sentation in the local area also appear to
spur native out-mobility. But native house-
holders are less likely to leave their neigh-
borhoods if surrounding areas—areas repre-
senting the most likely destinations—have
large shares of immigrants.

Our investigation indicates that much, but
not all, of the association between immigrant
populations and native out-mobility can be
attributed to the fact that immigrants tend to
settle in neighborhoods in which native popu-
lations have characteristics conducive to
mobility in general. However, while the data
do not lend themselves to explicit statements
of causality, our results suggest the impor-
tance of theoretically implicated mediating
factors that differentially explain the residual
link between local immigrant concentrations
and native out-mobility. Among whites,
mobility away from non-white neighbors, as
emphasized in the ethnic flight thesis, appears
to be an especially important component of
the association between immigrant popula-
tions and the likelihood of out-mobility.

The concentration of other-race neighbors
is also important in explaining native-born
blacks’ reactions to large shares of immi-
grants, but housing-market competition also
appears to be salient. Large shares of immi-
grants are associated with neighborhood hous-
ing characteristics, such as low levels of
homeownership and high housing costs, that
elevate the likelihood of out-mobility for
black householders. While native blacks’
and whites’ mobility away from immigrant
populations helps maintain their segregation
from Asian and Latino groups that make up
a large share of the foreign-born population,
these racially similar mobility patterns may
be driven by different underlying neighbor-
hood dynamics. For both blacks and whites,
however, residential mobility continues to be
enhanced by growth in immigrant populations
and reduced by the presence of larger
foreign-born populations in surrounding
neighborhoods.

As a first analysis of the link between
immigrant populations and native mobility
patterns at the individual level, this article
leaves open a number of important questions
for future research. First, additional attention
should be paid to variations in the association
between neighborhood immigrant concentra-
tions and residential mobility. Parallel
research on patterns of inter-regional migra-
tion indicates that variations by socioeco-
nomic status may be particularly important.
Such variations would hold additional impli-
cations for processes of neighborhood change
along racial and economic lines and may shed
additional light on the mechanisms through
which immigrant concentrations affect native
out-mobility. Similarly, native reactions to
neighborhood immigrant concentrations, and
the factors driving these reactions, may be sig-
nificantly conditioned by the national origins
or race of the immigrants in an area. Natives’
reactions may also vary significantly across
metropolitan areas with different histories of
immigration. Investigation of these variations
across traditional immigrant entry points and
emerging immigrant destinations, for exam-
ple, will shed light on shifting pattems of seg-
regation between immigrant and native
populations.

More generally, further research on the fac-
tors affecting native residents’ reactions to
foreign-born neighbors will be important.
Our strategy of examining the attenuation of
neighborhood compositional effects with con-
trols for individual- and tract-level character-
istics provides some hints at possible
mechanisms, but additional research on native
attitudes toward immigrant neighbors, pat-
terns of social interaction and political
exchange within changing neighborhoods,
and the connections to related residential
decision-making processes will surely prove
valuable. Similarly, assessing the mobility
responses of foreign-born householders and
their offspring to concentrations of immi-
grants—a topic that cannot be addressed
with the data used here—would provide clues
about the extent to which observed effects of
immigrant concentration reflect the influence
of other factors that increase residential
mobility in general.

Finally, important endeavors for future
work will be a fuller analysis of native- and
foreign-born populations’ mobility destination
choices and an assessment of how these
mobility processes are shaped by, and interact
with, broader structural and economic condi-
tions to affect aggregate population distribu-
tions. For now, we stop short of claiming
the United States is undergoing a process of
balkanization at the neighborhood level, paral-
leling the regional pattern identified by Frey
(1995). However, our analysis does point to
longstanding mobility dynamics that would
appear to diminish the prospects of residen-
tial integration between immigrants and
native-born populations. While scholarly
attention continues to focus on immigrants’
residential attainment processes, we call for
additional attention to native-born popula-
tions’ mobility reactions to these immigrant
settlement patterns. These reactions will
likely be crucial in determining the pace
and processes of neighborhood change,
immigrant incorporation, and broader pat-
terns of stratification.

. In metropolitan areas containing at least 2,500 His-
panics in both 1980 and 2000, the average residen-
tial dissimilarity score for Hispanics from blacks
was 51.6 in 1980 and 41.1 in 2000. By comparison,
the average dissimilarity of Hispanics from whites
was 39.5 in 1980 and 42.4 in 2000. Similarly, in
metropolitan areas with at least 2,500 Asians in
both years, the average Asian—black dissimilarity
score dropped from 62.2 to 50.5 between 1980
and 2000, while the average Asian—white dissimi-
larity score increased slightly from 37.0 to 37.9
(author calculations based on segregation scores
published by the Mumford Center [http://mumford
.albany.edu/census/WholePop/WPdownload.html]).

. Analyses using single-year mobility intervals for
data years prior to 1997 produce results similar to
those reported here.

. The multi-level structure of our data would ordinar-
ily call for the use of multi-level modeling strate-
gies (Teachman and Crowder 2002). However, the
low level of clustering of individual PSID respond-
ents within census tracts undermines the utility of
such models.

. We compared this inverse quadratic distance-
weighting strategy to results using spatial weights
based on: (1) adjacency, (2) inverse-distance, (3)
inverse logged distance, and (4) metropolitan location
(spatial weights set to 1 for all tracts in the same
MSA). These alternative strategies produce results
that are similar to, but generally weaker than, those
using the inverse quadratic distance strategy.

. Spatially proximate neighborhoods are presumed to
influence mobility decisions even if they are located
on the other side of an administrative boundary.
Thus, the spatial weights are not constrained by
county, metropolitan, or state borders.

. We use the average rent for all tracts within 10
miles for the small number of tracts with no
renter-occupied units. We also tested models with
the average value of owner-occupied housing, but
because of the high correlation with local rents
this control introduced considerable instability into
the models.

. The trend in the percent foreign born in PSID met-

tos parallels that in the country as a whole; in 1970,
about 4.7 percent of the U.S. population was cate-
gorized as foreign born, and this increased to 11.7
percent by 2003 (Larsen 2004).

. Here we utilize a cross-regressive modeling strategy

because our measure of extralocal immigrant con-
centrations reflects a spatially-lagged version of
a key predictor (Anselin 2003). This stands in con-
trast to more typical autoregressive forms of spatial
data analysis where a spatially lagged version of the
dependent variable is used as a predictor.

. Consistent with the distance-dependence argument,

about 85 percent of the mobile householders in our
sample moved to a tract that was, centroid-to-
centroid, less than 10 miles from the tract of origin.
In supplemental analyses, we find that distance
moved is positively associated with the relative
size of the immigrant population in extralocal areas,
net of the effects of micro-level factors that affect
mobility. When individuals do choose to move,
native householders who leave tracts surrounded
by relatively large foreign-born concentrations
tend to bypass these geographically nearby neigh-
borhoods—areas that are usually the most common
destinations for residential movers—in favor of
neighborhoods farther away.

. Supplemental analyses show that these effects are

not attributable to variations in mobility propensi-
ties across Census divisions. However, these analy-
ses do point to modest variations in the effects of
immigrant concentrations across traditional immi-
grant metros, emerging immigrant destinations,
and other types of metropolitan areas, with the def-
inition of these metropolitan types based on an
adapted version of the strategy employed by Lichter
and colleagues (2010). A full examination of these
differences, their variations across racial groups,
and the differential mechanisms across metropolitan
types is beyond the scope of this article.

. Analyses using various period splines in place of

the continuous measure for year of observation
lead to identical conclusions.

. Additional analyses show that, on average, mobile

white and black householders tend to enter neigh-
borhoods with lower concentrations of immigrants
than the neighborhoods they leave. This bolsters
the effects of mobility away from immigrant con-
centrations on segregation between native- and
foreign-born populations. This gap between immi-
grant concentrations in the origin and the destina-
tion increases proportionally to the size of the
immigrant concentration in the tract of origin and
