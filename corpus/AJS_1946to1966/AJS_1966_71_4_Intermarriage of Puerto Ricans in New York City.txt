According to the 1960 Census of Popu-
lation,? there were 612,574 Puerto Ricans
living in the city of New York; 429,710
(70 per cent) of these had been born in
Puerto Rico; 182,864 (30 per cent) had
been born in New York of Puerto Rican
parentage. The question is frequently
raised about the assimilation of the Puerto
Ricans into the New York community:
how rapidly are they becoming assimi-
lated; is their assimilation more rapid or
less rapid than that of immigrant groups
which came to the city at an earlier date?
The present study is an effort to determine
the rate of assimilation? on the basis of
marriage behavior. It indicates that as-
similation is proceeding rapidly.
In every study of cultural assimilation,
the factor of marriage is of central im-
portance. A high rate of intermarriage of
members of one ethnic group with another
is generally accepted as a reliable index
of cultural assimilation. Ruby Jo Reeves
used intermarriage as the crucial sign of
assimilation and found that ethnic groups
were intermarrying with other ethnic
groups, but within the three major faiths
of Protestant, Catholic, Jewish.* Will
Herberg accepts this same position.5 John
Thomas questions the fact that mar-
riages take place this way within religious
groups. He finds interreligious marriage
not only extensive, but increasing.6 These
three studies are all concerned with the
factor of intermarriage, especially inter-
religious marriage, in the process of as-
similation.”
®Data on color were taken from the marriage
records, but it is so difficult to make any reliable
judgment about color in the case of Puerto Ricans
that any attempt to analyze its significance on this
basis is useless. These difficulties are explored in
detail in J. P. Fitzpatrick, “Attitudes of Puerto
Ricans toward Color,” American Catholic Socio-
logical Review, XX (1959), 219-33. The designa-
tion of color on the marriage record is as the person
himself or herself declares it. The overwhelming
majority of Puerto Ricans declared themselves
white. For example, the color combinations ac-
cording to the marriage records are given in the
table below. The significance of color in Puerto
Rican marriages must be sought by another meth-
od. In the article just cited, the present author
reports on a 1958 study of marriages of Puerto
Ricans of noticeably different color, in which the
color of each partner was identified by the priest
performing the ceremony. Of 115 marriages studied,
the distribution according to color combination is
given below. Unfortunately, in neither case was
* Julian Drachsler, Intermarriage in New York
City (New York: Columbia University Press,
1921). Studies in intermarriage have been and con-
tinue to be of great interest to sociologists. The
earlier studies lacked accuracy, many of them be-
ing subject to the criticism of Price and Zubrzycki.
A number of studies, other than that of Drachsler,
have included New York City data. J. V. DePorte,
in “Marriages in the State of New York with
Special Reference to Nativity” in Human Biology
(May, 1931), pp. 387 ff., gives general statistics on
marriages between people of different nativity for
the years 1916-29 but discriminates between first
and second generation only for 1927-29. Only place
of birth is given, such as Poland or Russia, with
no indication whether the person was of German
or Jewish ethnic background. Only for Italian men
(1927-29) is it possible to draw an accurate con-
clusion about in-group, out-group marriage: 12
per cent of the first-generation Italian men mar-
ried out; 37.6 per cent of second-generation men
with two Italian parents; 62,7 per cent of second-
generation men with one Italian parent. The rate
of out-group marriage for second-generation Ital-
ian men is very high, but there is no way of deter-
mining from DePorte’s data whether the out-
group brides were third-generation Italians. J. H.S.
Bossard, in “Nationality and Nativity as Factors
in Marriage,” American Journal of Sociology, IV
(1939), 792-98, analyzes nearly 70,000 marriages
in New York State (excluding New York City) for
1936. He studied the rates of intermarriage be-
tween people of different nationalities and between
people of differing generations of the same na-
tionality. Bossard acknowledges the difficulty of
not being able to identify the Jews as an ethnic
group (p. 795); and he does not distinguish be-
tween French and English-speaking Canadians. The
most serious difficulty with Bossard’s study is that
many of the native-born of native parentage may
riage among second-generation immigrants,
namely 32 per cent.1° Drachsler analyzed
three hypotheses offered to explain this
intermarriage: (1) the sex ratio, the pre-
ponderance of the number of marriageable
men over the number of marriageable
women; (2) a rise in economic status
which places people of different nationality
groups (especially women) in closer con-
tact with the out-group; and (3) the
breakdown of the cohesive ethnic group.
Drachsler discounts hypotheses (1) and
(2) and accepts hypothesis (3) as the
only reasonable explanation for the high
rate of intermarriage in the second genera-
tion. In other words, intermarriage is an
index of cultural assimilation or integra-
tion.

In the present study, every marriage in
the city of New York of a first- or second-
generation Puerto Rican in the years 1949
and 1959 was reviewed, and all relevant
data were gathered from the marriage
record. The data were as follows:
ation, all persons are recorded as native-
born of native parentage, and it is no
longer possible to draw an accurate dis-
tinction between persons of different eth-
nic backgrounds.

In-group and out-group marriages were
determined by the following criteria:

In-Group: marriage of a first- or second-
generation Puerto Rican with a first- or
second-generation Puerto Rican.1!

Out-Group: marriage of a first- or
second-generation Puerto Rican with a
partner, born on the mainland of main-
land parentage; marriage with a partner
foreign-born or born in the United States
of foreign parents.!?

The data on out-group marriages are
presented in Table 1. The data give evi-
dence of a significant increase in the rate
of out-group marriages among second-
generation Puerto Ricans, both men and
women, in both 1949 and 1959. One diffi-
culty in these comparisons is the small
number of second-generation marriages in
comparison to first-generation. Neverthe-
less, the trend over the 10-year period was
consistent. And the trend indicates a
significant increase in out-group marriage.
Is the increase as significant as the in-
crease that occurred among former immi-
grants? In his study of immigrant mar-
riages of 1908-12, Drachsler’® found a
rate of out-group marriage of 10.39 per
cent for first-generation men, and of 10.1
per cent for first-generation women. This
rate of out-group marriage was higher than
the rate for first-generation Puerto Ricans
in either 1949 or 1959. The data are com-
pared in Table 1. However, the percentage
increase in out-group marriage from first
to second generation is almost the same
for all three groups. In fact, in terms of

However, there was no appreciable dif-
ference in total out-group marriages among
Puerto Ricans between 1949 and 1959. It
is only when the first generation is dis-
tinguished from the second that the in-
crease in out-group marriage appears as
a second-generation phenomenon, nor does
this have any relationship to the sex ratio.
In 1949, the sex ratio showed a marked
increase in the second generation (82 to
90), but there was a marked increase also
in the percentage of out-group marriages.
In 1959, there was little difference between
the sex ratio of the first and second gen-
eration (90 to 92); yet there was a marked

A number of factors enter into the
tendency toward lower age at marriage
for the second generation. It may simply
reflect the trend toward lower age at mar-
riage in Puerto Rico itself. However, as
Mills, Senior, and Goldsen pointed out
in their study of the Puerto Rican migra-
tion,® the migrating population is an
older population than that of the island.
Most migrating people are in their late
teens or early twenties. There is a selective
feature in economically motivated migra-
tions, since single people are more mobile.
The children of the migrants, however,
being settled in the new land, are evi-
dently tending toward the pattern of the
United States of younger age at marriage.

Finally, it may be of some help to ex-
amine the factor of religion in the mar-
riage of New York Puerto Ricans to de-
termine whether evidence from this source
may indicate the speed of assimilation.1®
No one has reliable evidence of the exact
number of Puerto Ricans who profess
Catholicism or Protestantism. The over-
whelming majority, probably 80-90 per
cent, profess the Roman Catholic faith,
although the level of instruction in the
faith is often very limited and the prac-
tice of the faith, as in most Latin areas,
is quite different from the practice that is
common in the United States.?° One no-
table contrast between Puerto Rico and the
United States mainland is in the extent
of the use of the Catholic religious cere-
mony at marriage. Religious marriage is
the overwhelming pattern for Catholic
people in the United States. John Thomas
estimates that 80 per cent of all marriages
involving a Roman Catholic are marriages
with a religious ceremony.”+

In Puerto Rico, however, the situation
is not easily determined. The pattern dif-
fers sharply from one area of the island
to another. The pattern also differs from
one year to another. Table 6 presents mar-
tiages according to type of ceremony for
selected areas of Puerto Rico for 1960. It
illustrates the wide differences from one
municipality to the other. Table 7 presents
marriages according to type of ceremony
for 1949, 1956, and 1960, to indicate the
wide fluctuations from year to year for all
marriages on the island. The percentage
of Protestant marriages tends to be rea-
sonably consistent. Variations in the per-
centage of Catholic and civil ceremonies
are not easy to explain. A sharp increase
in Catholic marriages may be the result of
island-wide parish missions. Variation may
also be due to the presence or absence of a
pastor from a parish. No one seems to have
a reliable explanation.

If one compares type of ceremony in
all Puerto Rican marriages in New York
(Table 8) with type of ceremony in Puerto
Rico, a number of differences appear im-
mediately. The percentage of civil mar-
riages is consistently much lower in New
York than in Puerto Rico. In 1949, the
percentage of Protestant marriages in New
York was much higher than that of the
island (50 versus 14.3 per cent), whereas

first and second generation, and data
which indicated that most of the Protes-

speaking ministers of Pentecostal and
Evangelical sects. The data on differences

The low percentage of civil marriages
and the consistent drop in civil marriages
from first to second generation may reflect
a tendency toward the preference for re-

The excellent study by Sidney Mintz”?
of the conversion of a poor sugar cane
worker in Puerto Rico to a Pentecostal sect
proposes the theory that poor people,
caught in the midst of upsetting change,
uprooted from a traditional way of life,
tend to seek security in the strong sense
of community which is characteristic of
the sect. Mintz’s theory could be projected
to the experience of migrating Puerto
Ricans, whose traditional way of life is
upset by migration rather than economic
development at home. The sect would
provide a means of security. A study by
Thomas F, O’Dea and Renato Poblete?*
of the storefront churches among Puerto
Ricans in New York supports the theory
of Mintz. O’Dea and Poblete indicate that
the sect has a strong attraction for the
poor and underprivileged, especially in the
process of transition in which they are
uprooted from their native land and find
themselves strangers in a strange and com-
plicated society. The informality of the
sect, the fact that all members are on the
same social and economic level, the active
participation in religious services, the
sense of brotherhood and community which
is fostered, its availability in the neigh-
borhood, all contribute to providing for
the poor and uprooted a sense of satis-
faction, of belonging in a community which
supports and strengthens them, However,
as the migrants become more firmly es-
tablished, as they find themselves more a
part of the larger society and able to inter-
act more effectively with it, they either
give up the practice of religion or convert
to their more traditional Catholic or es-
tablished denomination.

A further analysis of the data was made to
determine whether there was any relation-
2. Correlation between higher occupa-
tional status and out-group marriage is not
consistent. Among grooms the significant
variable is generation, not occupational
level. Among brides, out-group marriage
increases consistently as the occupational
level of their husbands rises. This suggests
that they may be marrying out in order to
marry up.

3. The only significant feature of age at
marriage is the change to lower age at
marriage among second-generation Puerto
Ricans in New York. They tend toward
the young age at marriage, which is char-
acteristic of the United States as a whole,
and appears to be a trend in Puerto Rico
also.

4. Civil marriage is much more common
in Puerto Rico than among Puerto Ricans
in New York. Protestant marriages in 1949
were much more common among Puerto
Ricans in New York than in Puerto Rico.
Catholic marriages increased between 1949
and 1959 in New York. There is a strong
tendency for Catholic marriages to in-
crease and Protestant marriages to de-
crease in the second generation in both
1949 and 1959. This appears to be related
to a decline in marriages by Spanish-speak-
ing Pentecostal arid Evangelical ministers.

5. Each of the above phenomena indi-
cates that on the basis of evidence of mar-
riage practice, the process of assimilation
to the culture of the U.S. mainland is in-
creasing rapidly. The positive correlation
of out-group marriage with second gener-
ation and with advance in occupational
status, the tendency toward younger age
of marriage, and the decline of interest in
the Evangelical and Pentecostal sects all
give evidence of the acceptance of main-
land American ways.
