HOUSING CONDITIONS IN CHICAGO, III: BACK OF
THE YARDS?

SOPHONISBA P. BRECKINRIDGE AND EDITH ABBOTT
The Chicago School of Civics and Philanthropy

In 1901, when a committee of the City Homes Association
made an inquiry into housing conditions in Chicago, the
Stockyards district was not one of those selected for intensive
investigation.2, The appearance of the district showed it to be
so neglected and conditions there were, in general, supposed to
be so extraordinary that it was regarded as unsuitable for pur-
poses of intensive investigation. On this account little atten-
tion was given to conditions prevailing within the houses, and
only a superficial examination of these conditions was made.
The unpaved streets, lack of sidewalks, indescribable accu-
mulations of filth and rubbish, together with the absence

1 Two other articles in this series appeared in the September and November
numbers of this Journal. This study is based on a house-to-house canvass and
reports on the district made by Jessie F. Bell, W. L. Chenery, Katherine S.
Gedney, Ethel E. Hanks, H. K. Herwitz, M. B. Hunt, Estelle B. Hunter, Caro
B. Macarthur, and Paul Wander, research students, 1909-10, and a special report
on the “City Dumps” by W. L. Chenery. The greater part of the most tedious
work of tabulation was done by Miss R. G. Stewart.

2The results of this investigation were published in 1901 in the well-known
report, Tenement Conditions in Chicago (8vo. pp. 207; published by the City
Homes Association).
of sewerage were said to make the so-called “outside insanitary
conditions as bad an any in the world.”?

Since the writing of that report many changes for
the better have taken place in this neighborhood. Many of
the streets have been paved, a large number of sidewalks have
been laid, the sewer system has been extended, and Bubbly
Creek has been enlarged and purified. The district remains,
however, an extraordinary one. No other neighborhood in this,
or perhaps in any other city, is dominated by a single industry
of so offensive a character. Large numbers of live animals
assembled from all sections of the country, processes of slaugh-
tering and packing, the disposition of offensive animal waste,
constitute an almost unparalleled nuisance. South Chicago lies
under the smoke-shadows of the steel mills, and in those mills
are dangers to life and limb, blinding glare from the furnaces,
magnificent exposure and terrible peril; but the influence upon

2 Ibid., 3 and 182. The comments on the district are as follows: “If the
purpose had been merely to select the worst houses and blocks that the city can
show, portions of the North and South Sides would have been chosen. The
Stockyards district and portions of South Chicago show outside insanitary con-
ditions as bad as any in the world. Indescribable accumulations of filth and
rubbish, together with the absence of sewerage, makes the surroundings of every
dilapidated frame cottage abominably insanitary. These evils do not extend
‘over a large area. They are in their worst forms extraordinary and not typical
of conditions elsewhere in Chicago. In the Stockyards district there is no large
area, such as the one in South Chicago, where the conditions seem to be uni-
formly bad. On Avenue there are some old rookeries and some new
little brick boxes raised on stilts, which will probably be sold on some instal-
ment plan to the working people in that vicinity. Many working people have
bought, or have tried to buy, these houses, but before they paid up the instal-
ments the houses were in very bad repair and wretchedly dilapidated. Very
often workmen have tried to buy them on the instalment plan and have lost
them again and again. There is a long row of houses on Avenue where the
conditions are about the same as stated above. Very few of the houses in this
locality are deficient in provision for light and ventilation, and none of them
seem to be overcrowded. The worst features are the external conditions which
surround the dwellings. In many parts of the district there are no sewers and
the sewage from the houses stands in stagnant pools. The south branch of the
Chicago River is really a ditch which accumulates a great deal of sewage from
the Stockyards, and fills the air with poisonous odors. The stench from the
Stockyards is also present. The district is overshadowed by heavy clouds of
smoke from ‘the Yards.’”

the neighborhood is rather terrifying than degrading. In the
Stockyards, on the other hand, are the mingled cries of the ani-
mals awaiting slaughter, the presence of uncared-for-waste, the
sight of blood, the carcasses naked of flesh and skin, the sug-
gestion of death and disintegration—all of which must react in a
demoralizing way, not only upon the character of the people, but
the conditions under which they live.

The packing industry has been identified with this territory
since 1864 when 320 acres of land “in the Town of Lake”
were bought from the Honorable John Wentworth for $100,-
000 as a site for the Union Stockyards which were then planned.
These yards were opened in December of the following yeart and
the growth of the industry since that time has been so rapid that it
is possible to understand, if not to excuse, the failure to adjust the
sanitary and physical conditions to the enlarged undertaking. The
result was, as all the world knows, that in 1906, when an attempt
was made to apply modern sanitary standards to the yards, provi-
sions for maintaining cleanliness and decency were found to be
so shockingly inadequate that employment there was believed to
have a demoralizing influence on the men and women employed
there. What this influence was can be better understood by
recalling the famous Neill-Reynolds Report® which called atten-
tion to the insanitary conditions then prevailing in the Stockyards,
the use of paving materials which could not be properly cleansed
and “were slimy and malodorous when wet, yielding clouds of ill-
smelling dust when dry”; the neglected condition of the pens in

*The packing industry in Chicago is of course much older than the
Union Stockyards. It is, in fact, almost as old as Chicago itself. Pork
packing was carried on in 1827 south of the north branch of the river on
Clybourn Avenue. In 1832 slaughtering and packing were industries located
on what was then an open prairie near Michigan and Madison streets. Later,
various other packing centers were established at Lake and LaSalle streets,
at Rush and Kinzie, on South Water between Clark and LaSalle, at State
and North Water, at Franklin and South Water. In 1848 the “Bull’s Head”
Yards on Madison and Ashland became the center of trade in live stock, but
later some other large yards were opened. In 1856 the Sherman Yards were

established on Cottage Grove Avenue, and in 1858 the Michigan Southern and
Fort Wayne Yards were opened on State and Twenty-second streets.

which the animals were confined, and of the viaducts over which
the animals passed; the unclean, dark, ill-ventilated rooms in
which the slaughtering was done, “vaults in which the air was
rarely changed; windows clouded by dirt, walls and ceilings so
dark and dingy that natural light penetrated only 20 or 30 feet”;
the lack of sanitary arrangements, with the consequent odors
and fumes, and the failure to provide ordinary decencies in the
way of toilet accommodations for the workers.

Obviously this is not one of the older residence districts of
Chicago. When this region was selected for the location of the
Union Stockyards it was a suitable place for an offensive busi-
ness of this kind. The whole territory was then a reedy, un-
drained marsh, remote from the inhabited part of the city, and
not regarded as a quarter which would ever be suitable for resi-
dence or business purposes. To this remote place the business
of slaughtering was suitably relegated. For much the same
reasons the brickyards and the city dumps were located here;
and this rural tract became appropriated to these necessary but
offensive uses.

This territory back of the “Yards” is, then, so unfortunate
in its blighted surroundings that great interest was felt as to what
actual living conditions might be in a dismal region with the
city dumps, brickyards, and “Bubbly Creek” on one side, and the
greatest slaughter-houses in the world on the other. Its very
peculiarities, as compared with other neighborhoods, seemed to
justify a study of its housing conditions. There were, how-
ever, other reasons for selecting this district for intensive inves-
tigation. The records of the United Charities show that a large
proportion of the applicants for relief come from this territory,
and the very poor are usually found living in the most insanitary
houses. There is a general belief that there is more tuberculosis
here than in any other part of the city, and a map published by
the commissioner of health shows that large numbers of babies
die here every year, and tuberculosis, high infant mortality,
poverty, and bad housing and sanitary conditions will generally
be found together. The Lithuanian and Polish families in this
neighborhood were known, too, to take large numbers of lodgers,
and this almost invariably means a violation of the law against
overcrowding. It should also be pointed out that the differences
between this district and several others to which reference might
be made, are differences in degree rather than in kind. No other
industry is just like the packing industry, but there are many in-
dustrial establishments which dominate the neighborhoods in
which they are located in much the same way as the packing in-
dustry dominates this. Houses of the same general type prevail
in other districts, and the people are like those near the Stock-
yards, immigrant men and women drawn here to render the un-
skilled service upon which so much of Chicago’s industry de-
pends.

The homes of this district have always been workmen’s
homes. Small frame cottages have gradually been displaced or
outnumbered by tenements built for two or more families; but
it has continued to be almost solidly occupied by those who
depend upon the yards for work and upon whose work the
industry, in turn, remains dependent.

In this district, as might be expected, were found representa-
tives of the various nationalities upon which the packing industry
had from time to time depended. In the earlier days, the work-
ers in the yards and the dwellers in the neighborhood were
almost exclusively Irish; but as they gradually found their way
into higher-grade work, they were succeeded first by the Ger-
mans and later by the Slavs, who, in the last decade, have
been immigrating in increasingly large numbers.

Two groups of blocks were selected for a house-to-house
canvass, one Polish and one Lithuanian, and an attempt was
made to select those which contained, not the poorest, but the
typical homes of this neighborhood. To these were added the
thin, straggling line of houses along Ashland Avenue known as
“Whiskey Row,” because it was believed that many lodgers
would be found here, and because this was also believed to be
typical of streets in other similar districts. The accompanying
map shows the whole neighborhood in its relation to the blocks
investigated.

The following table, which indicates how largely Slavic the
No column is given to Americans in the table, for out of 1,562
families visited only 19 American families were found. It is of
interest, too, that so few Irish are left and that a disproportion-
ate number of these are in Whiskey Row. These surviving Irish
residents were usually either among the most prosperous or the
most shiftless families in the neighborhood. The former are
often firemen or policemen who have remained in the same neigh-
borhood but have prospered equally with those who have moved
away. The Irish who have gone down and are still in the dis-
trict because they have never been prosperous enough to get
away, are usually living in very dilapidated and untidy houses,
It should be added that a few other Irish families are left, too,
because they unwisely bought their homes and have never been
able to dispose of them satisfactorily.

The fact of chief interest in the table, however, is that 1,167
out of 1,562 heads of households are Polish or Lithuanian.
When the large numbers of Polish and Lithuanian lodgers are
added to these family groups, it is clear that this is now a district

almost exclusively made up of Slavic immigrants, many of them
newly arrived and unable to speak any English. The problem
of the adjustment of the newly arrived immigrant is very closely
connected with the housing problem. It almost uniformly hap-
pens that the families which are most foreign are most exploited
in the matter of their housing situation. They pay the highest
rents for the poorest apartments, and they seem quite unable to
understand that they have a right to insist on needed repairs or
a decent standard of cleanliness. Ifa roof leaks, or the plumb-
ing is out of order, they have no idea how to set about getting
the landlord to attend to it. The student investigators
who made the house-to-house canvass reported that their
authority was rarely questioned among the less Americanized
groups; the people were uniformly submissive, and apparently
it never occurred to them that they had a right to ask why
strangers could come in and measure their doors and windows.

It is a well-known fact that the unskilled work in the yards
is largely done by the members of these foreign groups. Ad-
ditional evidence, however, is found in the following table which
shows that of the 876 heads of families (men) whose occupa-
tions were learned, only 152 did work requiring any considerable
degree of skill.

The first ten blocks are uniform in size and each contains
3.3 acres. The most densely populated block therefore contains
306 people to the acre, and the average density is 208. The
average number of persons per acre found in the two sections of
the Jewish district which was investigated in 1901 was 245 and
248 respectively; the number in the densely populated Polish
quarter investigated at the time was 340. In comparison with
these figures, it appears that, although the degree of density in
the Stockyards district is high, the number of people per acre is
smaller than in some other sections of the city. It will appear,
however, that the real problem of overcrowding here is crowd-
ing within the house and within the rooms.

It is to be noted in the first place that the buildings are often
small and cover a relatively small portion of the lot. Thus the
following table shows that nearly half of the premises were not
covered more than 50 per cent, and that a considerable number

were entirely vacant.

* Of these 43 were vacant premises.

It is interesting to compare these figures for a section of the
Twenty-ninth Ward with those which were published by the
City Homes Association for other parts of the city. In 1901
it.was found that in the districts investigated on the West Side,
39 per cent of all the lots were covered more than 65 per cent,
and that 17 per cent of the lots were covered more than 80 per
cent.© In comparison with these percentages, the figures given
above show that in the territory back of the yards there is a
relatively large amount of open space.

It is of further interest that the houses here not only occupy
a small percentage of the lot, but they are almost uniformly
frame buildings not more than two stories high.7 In this dis-
trict, therefore, a relatively high density per acre is found to-
gether with a relatively small percentage of the lot covered by
small low houses. The condition is especially interesting because
typical of so many districts in Chicago. The small houses and
vacant lots, so unlike the crowded areas of the tenement districts
in New York, give the impression that there is no serious prob-
lem of congestion here. This impression, however, is a mis-

leading one since the facts which have been given show a high
degree of crowding within the houses. Tables which will be
given later, dealing with the number of occupants per room,
show that in this district sleeping-rooms especially are crowded
far beyond the legal limit and this overcrowding within the
house is often a source of much greater danger and demoraliza-
tion than the more obvious overcrowding in other cities.

Although this is a relatively new section of the city, the great
majority of the houses, 488 out of 623° were built under the old
tenement law, that is, prior to 1903. Some blocks, of course,
contain a much large proportion of old houses than others.
In those more recently built up, less than half are old-law
houses. Although the houses are frame and so many of them
built more than ten years ago, they were in general in good
repair® except in Whiskey Row. There the buildings were found
to be in general old and dilapidated, the plumbing out of order,
the houses dirty, and the people who lived there often low and
disreputable.

The alley tenement is a conspicuous feature of Chicago’s
housing problem but it is not so prevalent back of the yards as
in some other districts. In the fifteen blocks investigated, how-
ever, 73 alley tenements were found. In two especially crowded
blocks, 13 out of 50, and 13 out of 61 houses respectively were
alley houses. On a few premises there were three houses on
a single lot, that is, not only front and rear but middle dwell-

meng “UY gq ydvssojoyg
ings as well.*° The alley houses, therefore, are almost uniformly
old houses, and for sanitary provisions they are frequently en-
tirely dependent upon a yard water-closet or privy. These alley
houses are, however, usually light and sunny, because in this
neighborhood, with a large proportion of the lots having a vacant
space in the rear, a rear house is likely to have more chance for
light and air than the front house with only a narrow passage
on either side.

Further discussion of the conditions prevailing here should
be prefaced by reference to the distinction between tenements
and other dwellings. According to the definition in the Code,
any house is a tenement and subject to tenement regulation when
it is used as a dwelling by two or more families living in sepa-
rate apartments."

The following table which shows the number of houses occu-
pied by a specified number of families confirms the earlier state-
ment that this is not a district of large tenement houses:
This table shows that in 155 cases the houses which were
investigated were not tenement houses and were therefore
regulated, not by the provisions of the tenement code relating
to “Class VI” houses, but by the minor restrictions relating to
so-called Class III houses, that is, houses used as dwellings for
single families.1? It should, however, be pointed out that bad
sanitary conditions are just as evil for the family living alone
in the small house as for the family which happens to be occupy-
ing a house in which another family also lives.18 For this reason
it has seemed best to include all of the houses visited, single
as well as tenement, in the tables given in the following pages. If
in some cases the law was not violated because the houses were
occupied by a single family, the condition was none the less in-
sanitary because it was legal. The community is quite as likely
to suffer when six people sleep in a room not having enough
cubic air space for one person, even if there is only a single
family, instead of two or three, living in the house.

It is important to know not only the number of apartments
per house but the number of rooms per apartment, and the fol-
lowing table therefore is given showing the number of apart-
ments having from one to eight rooms:

Number of apartments having 1 room....
Number of apartments having 2 rooms....

It is encouraging to note that although some very small dwell-
ings are to be found, 17 consisting of only one room, more
than 80 per cent of all the apartments consist of four or more
rooms. The location of the apartment is a question of great im-

portance. The basement apartment is not illegal but it is often
dark and damp, and the fact that 137 families were found in
basement apartments is a significant fact. Although cellar apart-
ments, that is, those which are more than half below the street
level’ have been declared illegal, seven were found, two in
Whiskey Row and five in the group of blocks which were pre-
dominantly Lithuanian. These cellar apartments are invariably
cheerless and insanitary. In one house on Paulina Street, two
Lithuanian girls were found in two very dismal cellar rooms
in which they cooked and slept. The ceilings of their little
apartment were only five feet nine inches high; one of the
rooms was windowless and the other had two small windows
opening on a passage so that one room was totally dark and the
other gloomy, and the cellar space back of the apartment was
dark and damp.

It was surprising to find in a comparatively new building on
Ashland Avenue another gloomy two-room cellar apartment with
ceilings which were only six feet. A Polish “yards” laborer
and his wife slept in the bedroom and a woman lodger and
one child slept in the kitchen. Both of these rooms had win-
dows which were so much below the street that you could read
only a short distance away from them. The rooms were un-
necessarily darkened by the fact that the walls were painted a
dark green and the apartment was rendered more objectionable

“Tolman, Municpal Code, Secs. 398, 417, 430; Cellar Changed for
Living Purposes—Requirements.—Height—In no now existing or new tene-
ment house shall any room in the cellar be constructed, altered, converted or
occupied for living purposes; and no room in the basement of a tenement
house shall be constructed, altered, converted or occupied for living purposes,
unless all of the following conditions of this chapter be complied with, and at
least one-third of the height of the basement shall be above grade for building;
provided, in each case it shall be at least four feet above the street grade.

“Such rooms shall be at least eight feet six inches high in all now existing
or new tenement houses in every part from floor to ceiling, except as provided
for janitor’s use only in section 417 of this chapter.

“‘Basement’ is a story partly, but not more than one-half, ‘Cellar’ is a
story more than one-half, below the level of the street grade nearest the build-
ing; where the grade of a street adjacent to a tenement house varies, the mean
or average grade of such street opposite the lot containing the tenement house
shall be regarded as the grade of such street within the meaning of this chapter.”
by the fact that it could only be reached through a dark, damp
cellar-space used for coal. The fact that there are so few cellar
apartments shows an improvement over conditions in 1901 when
the City Homes investigation was made. At that time twenty
cellar apartments were found in the forty blocks which consti-
tuted the first district, forty-nine cellar apartments in the second
district of ten blocks, and thirty-two cellar apartments in the
third district of eight blocks.

The primitive sanitary arrangements which still exist in this
neighborhood are a result in part of the newness of the dis-
trict, in part of the low standard of living that prevails among
the people, and in greater part perhaps of their ignorance,
poverty, and general helplessness. An ordinance passed in
18941 made it illegal for privy vaults to be maintained on
premises where sewers were possible, and this ordinance is still
in force. In these few blocks, however, 44 privies with 21
separate vaults were found. The evil is greater than the num-
ber indicates, for 46 families and 248 persons used these miser-
able toilet accommodations which are so offensive and insanitary
that they were outlawed fifteen years ago.1®

The yard closet should be classed with the privy as a nui-
sance, and is forbidden for new tenements by the present law.
On 233 premises, however, 447 yard water-closets were found
and these were used by 3,419 people. In fourteen cases, the
premises were regulated by the new law, and the yard
water-closets were therefore as illegal as privy vaults.
In many other cases where they existed, the accom-

See City Homes Report, 104, and the present health ordinance, Tolman,
Municipal Code, sec. 1289: “It shall be unlawful for any person or corporation
to maintain any privy vault or suffer the same to be and remain upon any
premises shutting upon or adjoining any street, alley, court or public place, in
which is located any public sewer. Any person or corporation violating the
provisions of this section shall be fined not less than ten or more than two

dependent on facilities of this primitive type. It is encouraging, however, to
note the progress which has been made since 1901. At that time 1,581 privies

were found in the forty blocks east of Halsted Street and these were used by
more than 10,000 people. See City Homes Report, 105.

each apartment having more than two rooms, only one-fourth of
the apartments visited had such private toilet facilities.17 The
needs of the families in these 1,119 apartments which were with-
out water-closets were met in part by the primitive yard closets
and privies, but in the majority of cases by closets in the basement
or hall which were used either by several or by all of the families
in the building. In 127 buildings the tenants used water-closets
in the basement or cellar and in 155 buildings the water-closets
were in the halls.1® In one building there was only one water-
closet for five families, in another one for six families and in an-
other one for seven families. In a neighborhood like this, where

**23 of the basement closets and 42 of the hall closets were in new-law
buildings. The ordinance, however, is a complicated one and apartments of less
than three rooms may legally be provided with common toilets.

The Code, sec. 434, is as follows: “In every new tenement house there
shall be a separate water-closet in a separate compartment within each apart-
ment, accessible to each apartment, without passing through any other apartment,
provided that where there are apartments, consisting of only one or two rooms,
there shall be at least one water-closet for every two apartments. Every water-
closet compartment in every new tenement house shall have a window opening
upon a street, alley, yard, court, or vent shaft, and every water-closet compart-
ment in every existing tenement house shall be ventilated by such a window,
or else by a proper ventilating pipe running through the roof. Every water-
closet compartment in every tenement house shall be provided with proper
means of artificially lighting the same. If fixtures for gas or electricity are not
provided in any such compartment, then the door thereof shall have ground
glass or wire glass panels or transoms.
the family usually includes a large number of lodgers as well,
such inadequate facilities unquestionably constitute a demoraliz-
ing influence. In one case a single water-closet was the only ac-
commodation provided for 47 persons.1® In several cases, the
public closets in saloons were the only provisions made for fami-
lies with young children.

These inadequate toilet arrangements are also objectionable
because the great majority of them are of the old long-hopper
type, and because the compartments are dark and frequently with-
out any means of ventilation.2° Moreover, while in general the
private closet within the apartment was found to be clean and in
good repair, those used by several families or by all the families
in a building were in the majority of cases dirty and out of
order.?1_ It would seem to be beyond any question that families
with young children should be provided with adequate toilet
facilities, which can be kept clean and in good repair. It is clear
that the insanitary accommodations which are only too often
dark, out-of-order, offensive, used by large groups of men
lodgers, and often by other families not clean in their habits,
are mostly a degrading and contaminating influence which could
easily be prevented.

*The following table shows the provision of toilet accommodations for

Conditions within the apartment are supposedly governed by
certain regulations bearing upon the questions of light and air,
and cubic air space per person. The most important of thesc,
though undoubtedly the most difficult of enforcement, is the pro-
vision which attempts to prevent overcrowding by requiring for
each occupant a definite minimum of space. It is illegal for any
room in a tenement house to be so occupied that each adult per-
son “living or sleeping” in the room does not have at least 400
cubic feet of air, and each child under twelve, 200 cubic feet of
air.2? This provision applies to old-law and new-law houses

alike, but the following table shows how persistently this law is
violated. All of the numbers above the black line, 1,981 in all,

room was greater than the law allowed:

* In this table one adult means one adult or two children under twelve, that is, the term one adult
is used whenever 400 cubic feet of air are required.
This table shows that in 1,981 cases the law against over-
crowding was violated, and that in many instances the number
of cubic feet in the room was shockingly below the number of
cubic feet required by law. Thus it appears that in 19 cases
when rooms of 350 to 400 cubic feet were being illegally occu-
pied, in two cases, 600 cubic feet, in ten cases 800, and in one
case 1,000, and in another 1,400 were required by law. In 77
cases when 1,200 cubic feet of air were required, rooms con-
taining less than 800 cubic feet were occupied. In one case
four people slept in a room containing only 333 cubic feet, a
room that could not have been legally occupied by even a single
person over twelve years of age. In another case five people
slept in a room containing 472 cubic feet, a room that could
legally be occupied only by a single person. In another case
seven people, for whom 2,800 cubic feet would have been the
legal minimum, slept in a room containing only 657 cubic feet.

One of the worst features of this overcrowding is the de-
moralizing lack of privacy. Grown brothers and sisters, for
example, often occupy the same room. Sometimes the crowd-
ing is unnecessary; the family prefer, especially in the winter,
to huddle into the rooms which are near the kitchen and in
this way save the expense of extra fuel and an extra stove.
In one apartment a bedroom which was light and sunny was
left vacant, although the family were sleeping in a dark room
which had only one window opening into a hall. The dark
room was of course near the kitchen.

The secret of the overcrowding which prevails here is to be
explained in part by the un-American standard of living.
Polish and Slovak women, for example, told of conditions in
their own homes where a large family often lived in one or
two rooms.

Further testimony on the subject of overcrowding is to be
found in the following table which shows that in a large num-
ber of cases every room in the house was used as a sleeping-
room.

It appears from this table that in 106 families even the
kitchen was used as a bedroom at night. In 508 cases all the
rooms except one were used as bedrooms at night. It is of
interest that the different blocks varied in this respect; the
four Polish blocks (7, 8, 9, 10) had more rooms that were not
slept in and the Whiskey Row blocks contained the largest
proportion of apartments in which even the kitchen was a
sleeping-room.

With regard to the size of the room, the ordinance pro-
vides that in each apartment there shall be at least one room

containing not less than 120 square feet, and that every room
shall contain at least 70 square feet.28 Although this pro-
vision applies only to new tenements, that is, those erected since
1903, the sanitary requirements are quite independent of the
legal requirements and rooms below the minimum size are just
as objectionable in the old houses as in the new houses. In
attempting, therefore, to ascertain how many rooms failed to
conform to the standard set in the law, all apartments in old
as well as in new houses were considered.

3 This section of the code (417) is as follows: “In every new tenement
house, all rooms, except water-closet compartments and bathrooms, shall be of
the following minimum sizes: In each apartment there shall be at least one
room containing not less than 120 square feet of floor area, and every other
room shall contain at least 70 square feet of floor area. Each room shall be in
every part not less than 8 ft., 6 in. high in but one-half of its area; provided,
that in a basement apartment used for janitor’s use only, such room or rooms
shall be not less than 2 ft. high in the clear.”
Out of the 1,616 apartments which were visited, 1,459
rooms were found which contained less than 70 square feet of
floor area, the legal minimum prescribed in the ordinance.
Some of these rooms were shockingly below the requirement.
One man slept in a room with an area of 18 square feet,
another in a room which had an area of 24 square feet and
which was so low that it contained only 94 cubic feet; still
another occupied a room containing only 28 square feet; in
another case four people slept in a room containing only 37
square feet and 333 cubic feet; and in another room, containing
59 square feet and 472 cubic feet, five people slept. Five entire
apartments were found containing less than 120 square feet,
the minimum size prescribed for at least one room in every
apartment, and four of these contained less than 100 square
feet. A large number of rooms were found to be inadequate
in light as well as in area. The ordinance prescribes for rooms
in new tenement houses a minimum height of eight and a half
feet, but 935 rooms?* were found which failed to conform to
this requirement.

Quite as important as the size of the rooms is the question of
what provision is made for light and ventilation. In state-
ments concerning light and air it is, of course, important to
avoid the influence of the personal equation. A room which
one person calls light, another may call gloomy, and what is
bad ventilation to some seems adequate to others. One definite
test, however, is whether the rooms have windows and whether
the windows can be opened to the outer air, that is, whether
it is possible to let in light and air if the occupants can be
convinced of their importance. A further test is found in the
provision of the code which provides, as a means of securing
adequate light and ventilation, that in every new tenement house
“every habitable room” must have its window area equal to one-
tenth of its floor area and that all windows shall open

This includes rooms in both old and “new” houses, as well as janitor

rooms which are excepted from the requirement. The preceding note quotes
this section of the ordinance in full.
directly to the outer air.2> Although this provision like
so many others applies only to “new-law” houses, it seems
important to apply this standard, which the community has set,
to all the houses which were visited. It was found that 137
rooms were without any windows at all or without any win-
dows opening to the outer air; of these, 123 were sleeping-
rooms and 36 were in new-law houses. The number of persons
occupying these windowless bedrooms is shown in the follow-
ing table:

The ordinance (sec. 413) regulating windows is as follows: “In every
new tenement house every habitable room, excepting water-closet compartments
and bathrooms, shall have all windows open direct upon a street, alley, yard or
court. The total area of the windows opening from any such room (other than
water-closet compartments and bathrooms) upon a street, alley, yard, or court,
shall be at least one-tenth of the floor area of that room.... - ”’ The section
(418) governing old houses is much more lax in its requirements: “No room
in any now existing tenement house shall hereafter be constructed, altered, con-
verted, or occupied for living purposes unless it contains a window having a
superficial area not less than one-twelfth of the floor area of the room, which
window shall open upon a street or alley or upon a yard or court having a
superficial area of not less than 25 square feet; or unless such room adjoins
another room in the same apartment, which other room shall have such a window
opening upon such a street, alley, yard, or court, and between which two
adjoining rooms there shall be a sash window having at least 15 square feet of
glazed surface, the upper half of which shall be so made as to open easily.”
Even when the house is a private dwelling and not a tenement the windowless
room is supposed to be controlled. The corresponding section (285) for the
private house is as follows: “In buildings of Class III, no room shall be con-
This table shows how very bad a windowless room may
at times become. In two cases, five persons were sleeping in
a room which had no window except one opening into another
room; in nine cases, four persons slept in a similar windowless
room; in twenty cases three persons occupied such a room.
Altogether 232 persons slept in rooms of this type. Some-
times several of these bedrooms were found in a single apart-
ment and several of these inadequately ventilated apartments
in a single building. For example, twenty-three of the 119
bedrooms were in three buildings. In one two-room apartment
occupied by three people, both rooms were really without com-
munication with the outer air because the windows were so ob-
structed; in another department three of the four rooms were
for all practical purposes windowless.

In addition to these cases of windowless rooms, 372 others
were found in which the window area was less than 10 per
cent of the floor area.2® These 509 cases of windowless rooms
and rooms in which the window area failed to meet the re-
quirements prescribed in the city code were only a small propor-
tion of the total number of rooms reported to be inadequately
lighted. Two hundred and six rooms were found which
were called “dark” and 1,410 which were called “gloomy”
by the students who visited them. A “dark” room was,
in general, a room in which you could read only when you
were standing by the window, and a “gloomy” room was one in
which you could read only a few feet away from the window.
A careful study of the conditions in these 1,616 dark and gloomy
rooms makes it clear that the area of the window is much less
apog “ya 64 yd vssoqoyg
The most significant fact perhaps in this table is that 1,211 of
the 1,584 gloomy rooms are deprived of light because the build-
ing on the next lot is so close that only a narrow passageway
or a narrow space hardly wide enough to be called a passage is
left between the two houses. The typical city lot in Chicago is
long and narrow, usually 25 feet wide and 125 feet long, and
this has led to the practice of building houses close to the lot
line on both sides. To leave adequate space on either side means
the building of an inconveniently narrow house and the attempt
to avoid this has resulted in a large number of dark rooms. A
study of these dark rooms makes clear the fact that adequate
light and ventilation cannot be secured by regulating the window
area; the controlling factor is the size of the yard or court upon
which the window opens. Thus, although only a small proportion
of the dark rooms could be explained by lack of window area,
75 per cent were clearly due to the fact that the windows
opened on a court which was only a narrow passage between
two houses, both of which were built close to the lot line.

A neighborhood problem of great importance in connection
with housing and especially with overcrowding is the custom of
taking lodgers who are usually unmarried men or women em-
ployed in the Stockyards. This custom is a common one in
most of the immigrant districts of our large cities, and the
Stockyards district, in so far as it suffers from this evil, is a
typical and not an exceptional neighborhood.?”_ The large num-
ber of immigrants, both men and women, who find it easy to get
employment in the yards wish, when they first come to this
country, to live near their work, and among people of the same
nationality. The families who live in the neighborhood are
therefore constantly tempted to add to their income by taking
in one more lodger. Only 768 out of the 1,616 families visited
said that they had no lodgers. That is, more than one-half of
the families added to their income by filling up their rooms to
the utmost capacity with the men and women who were too new
to this country to realize that they could demand anything more
than a place to sleep.?® They sleep on the floor both with and
without mattresses and sleep in beds with people who are total
strangers. The importance of “the lodger evil” can best be
understood by studying the following table which shows the total
number of lodgers in relation to the total number of people in
each block :

This table shows that 2,061 men and 332 women out of the
8,731 people in the blocks which were investigated were lodgers;
that is, the lodgers constitute one-third of the neighborhood
population. In connection with these figures it should be re-
called that these 3,383 lodgers lived with 794 families, an
average of three lodgers to each family. As was expected, more
lodgers were found in Whiskey Row in proportion to the num-
ber of families than in the other districts. Instead of finding
two or more families living above the saloon, the second floor
was frequently provided with accommodations for lodgers, and
in a few cases the apartments had been subdivided into small
rooms.

The fact that there are several lodgers in a family means seri-
ous overcrowding in these small apartments in which the rooms
are often under the legal area and under the legal height, as
well as frequently dark and inadequately ventilated; it means a
great deal of additional work for the overburdened wife and
mother who has a constant excuse for not maintaining a
satisfactory standard of cleanliness. It also means a_ sac-

rifice of privacy; for in many cases the lodgers sleep
in the same room with some member of the family;
in 181 cases there was one member of the family sleeping
in the lodger’s room and sometimes in the same bed; in 60
cases two members of the family slept in the room; in 23 cases
there were three members of the family, in 9 cases four, and in
three cases five, sleeping in the same room and in one case the
lodger slept in the same room with a family of seven.°° Some-
times men and women lodgers slept in the same room; in other
cases the men slept in a room which could only be reached by
passing through a room in which the women slept. In other cases
men lodgers slept in the same rooms with the young daughters of
the household, and no one seemed aware of dangers or impro-
prieties. Perhaps the worst feature of the mixed lodging arrange-
ment, however, is the common toilet-room. When it is in the
apartment the entrance is almost invariably from the kitchen
which often serves at night as a bedroom.

The practice of taking lodgers is, of course, to be explained
by the fact that the families are large, the earnings small, and
the rents high. The lodger, however, is as much the cause as
the effect of high rents; the landlord finds it easy to excuse a high
rental by pointing out that the families will surely take lodgers
and earn enough to pay it.84 It is difficult to discuss the sub-

This table shows that one-fourth of the families pay less than
$7 and more than half of them pay less than $9. Much more
interesting, however, than the amount paid is the question of
the kind of accommodations secured. Two tables therefore are
given which show in some detail the relation of the rent paid to
the number of rooms and to the floor area of the apartment.

This table of rents is given in some detail, because it shows
not only the number of rooms obtained for a given rental, but
it also brings out the tendency to make the unit in even dollars.
That is, the rents are usually $5, $6, $7 instead of $5.25, $5.75
and so on. It is interesting that the rent paid bears very little
relation to the number of rooms obtained. The rent of a one-
room apartment may be $7, $4, $3, or even less. Two-room
apartments bring almost any rental between $3 and $7. Six-
teen different rentals ranging from $4 to $13 are paid for four-

room apartments.

The size of the apartment in relation to the rent is quite as
important as the number of rooms. The following table shows,
however, that the size is not a factor any more than the number

of rooms in determining the rent paid.

important factor. It was found that the most recent immigrants
almost invariably paid higher relative rents than those among

their neighbors who were more Americanized, and who had a
more correct idea of the market value of the accommodations.

In this as in most immigrant neighborhoods, a large number
of families either own or are buying the house in which they live.
It was found that 298 out of 613 premises were owned by people
living on them. This 48 per cent of ownership is, however,
likely to give a false impression of prosperity, for many of these
places which the people claim to own are heavily encumbered and
in many instances after a long struggle the house and all that has
been paid slips away. The old idea of the prosperous workman
owning a house of his own—usually a small cottage with a
cheerful garden—fails of illustration in the immigrant tenement
neighborhoods found in all large cities. The owners here are
only tenement landlords who live on the premises. Instead of
small cottages they buy tenements containing several apartments*?
which can be rented for enough to pay the interest on the mort-
gage and some small part toward its rédemption. In these cases
ownership is far from being a sign of prosperity which indicates
comfort. The owner of the tenement frequently lives in the
smallest and poorest apartment. If there is an attic or a cellar
in the houses that can be rented only with difficulty the owner
and his family occupy it, in order that the more desirable apart-
ments may be used to make the house bring in the largest possi-
ble return.

It should be pointed out that although one-half of the premi-
ses may be owned by people living on them there are a large num-
ber of other families on these same premises who are “renters.”
To compare, therefore, the number of premises owned with the
total number of premises gives a disproportionate idea of the
ownership factor. A more correct idea can be had by comparing
the number of families who live in an apartment in a house
which they own with the total number of families. Out of a
total of 1,616 families, only 298 were not paying rent, so that
it is less misleading to say that one-fifth of the people live in
houses which they own than to say that one-half of the premises
are owned by people who live on them.

These resident landlords make the reform of housing con-
ditions very difficult. Many of them, as the following table
shows, have purchased the property very recently.

In these cases of recent purchase not only are the landlords
very poor, but their entire margin of saving for years is mort-
gaged to pay for the house. There is not only no hope of their
making improvements, but they will not even make needed re-
pairs until they are compelled to do so.

It has already been said that they usually live in the meanest

%2In only 50 per cent out of 296 cases in which the owner lived on the

premises did he occupy the house alone with his family.

In 67 cases the house contained 2 apartments
In 64 cases the house contained 3 apartments
In 63 cases the house contained 4 apartments
In 52 cases the house contained 5 or more apartments
apartment in the house. Often they do not even occupy an
apartment but huddle the entire family into one room in order
that the house may be made to earn more of what is due on the
mortgage. One house on Paulina Street containing four apart-
ments and an attic room was owned by a Lithuanian Stock-
yards laborer with five children. The four apartments were all
rented, however, and the family were living in the attic which is
shown in the photograph.

In many cases where there is a store in the building, the
storekeeper is the owner and the resident landlord. He may be
more prosperous than the men who work in the yards but, as
in most other cases of ownership, the prosperity may mean a con-
tinual sacrifice of comfort in the home. The family usually
live in the rather gloomy and crowded rear rooms behind the
store, in order that all of the apartments above may be rented.
To save the expense of a clerk, the wife and mother usually
“helps” in the store, and the result is that the house is often
dirty and ill-kept.

There are stores everywhere, sometimes more than one in a
building; but the corner lot is usually occupied by a saloon.
Sometimes both are found on the same premises. One corner
building contained a saloon, a butcher shop, a milk depot, a
bakery, a stable at the rear, and apartments for nine families.
The saloons are usually the property, not of the saloonkeeper, but
of the brewery which often owns other property near by. The
saloonkeeper is nevertheless a person of influence, and the hall
in the rear of the saloon is a social center in which weddings and
other festivities occur. In the ten blocks visited there were thirty
saloons, while in Whiskey Row there were forty-six.

The following table shows the number of saloons in each
block and the percentage of buildings which are used for dwell-
ings only:

There is, however, another feature of this neighborhood
which is more offensive than the Stockyards and the saloons.
Reference has already been made to the fact that conditions in
the yards must be a demoralizing influence on the people who
live near; but along with the influence of the Stockyards should
be reckoned that of the great city “dump.” <A brief statement
concerning the exact location and the extent of the “dump” as
well as the way in which it is used by the city as a place of
deposit for waste matter from distant wards will perhaps throw
some further light upon conditions in this section of the city.
In an open tract lying between Forty-seventh and Forty-second
streets and near the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago, & St.
Louis Railroad are four places of deposit which are indicated
on the accompanying map: the first, which is just north
of Forty-seventh Street and west of the railroad, con-
tains about seven acres; the second, north of Forty-seventh Street
and east of the railroad, contains five acres; the third and fourth
which are also east of the tracks contain respectively ten and six
acres. These “dumps” are great holes from which the clay has
been dug out for the neighboring brickyards. In the autumn of
1909, when our investigation was made, No. 1 (see map) had
been filled with deposits of waste matter until it was almost level

— —————
with the street ; No. 2 had been nearly filled, but clay was still be-
ing removed so that the space continued to be enlarged; No. 3
which was still filled with water had been as yet only slightly
used as a dumping-ground; while No. 4 was abandoned as a
clay pit and was about half full of refuse.

The city, as required by the ordinance,°* collects and disposes
of all garbage, ashes, and rubbish except such as is gathered
from places in which more than twenty people are fed. The
ashes and rubbish are dumped, while the garbage thus collected
is supposed to be treated at a reduction plant.34 The waste
from the places where more than twenty people are fed is dis-
posed of at the expense of the establishment. The large hotels
burn their garbage, but the smaller ones dump theirs mixed with
ashes and miscellaneous waste on a public dump approved by the
commissioner of public works.?> Dump No. 1 seems to be the
place of deposit by the city for solid waste matter from the
Fifth, Twelfth, and Thirty-first wards, and such food stuffs as
are found there are doubtless due to the neglect of housekeepers
to separate the material collected. Dump No. 2, on the other
hand, was used prior to October, 1909, not only by the city as
a place of deposit of the solid waste from four wards but by pri-
vate scavengers. In this way it became such a nuisance in the
district near Forty-seventh Street and Western Avenue, that
the city authorities were induced to transfer this private
dumping to dump No. 4, which is used by private scavengers
and which is also the place of deposit for the waste from the
First, Second, Third, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, Eighteenth,
Nineteenth, and Twentieth wards. Dump No. 3 is used by the
Stockyards and, as their waste is largely burned, there is always
a smouldering fire here, separated by a pool of water from the
inflammable material on the city dump.

Obviously the material deposited in these dumps is of several
kinds : ashes and other substances which are suitable for filling-in
purposes and which can probably be put to no other use; cans,

% Municipal Code, sec. 1097.
bottles, old junk, wooden boxes, and other articles which have
served their original purpose, which are not suitable for filling-in
purposes, but which may properly be used again; old mattresses,
worn garments, and articles of personal use which come from
all sorts of homes in all sorts of places, which may easily convey
infection, and which in the interests of public health should be
destroyed; and finally waste food, which comes both from
the establishments of which mention has been made and from
food dealers like those on South Water Street. It should be
added that articles of real value are not infrequently mixed in
with the refuse by mistake.

These various kinds of waste tempt different kinds of per-
sons to explore the dumps. On dumps Nos. 2 and 4 there are the
professionals, who pay a regular stipend for the privilege of
“picking” and who dispose of the articles collected in the
regular course of trade.9” For the picking on dump No. 4, a
payment of $15 a week is made by a man who employs five
helpers. After these commercial pickers have taken their goods,
the women and children, who have been watching the wagon
unload and the picking take place, are allowed to hunt for the
wood they want for kindling, the old mattresses which may
serve on the bed at home, and the fragments of food. Of course
the prospective find is most uncertain, but for both the women
and children there is the excitement of exploration and the hope
of a bit of silver or some other article of value, such as a lucky
neighbor was rumored to have found. It is hardly necessary
to say that the filthy condition of some of the household articles
and the presence of decaying organic matter, make this an ob-
viously unfit place for children.3*

36 An ex-alderman in the ward is said to farm out for an annual payment
the right to pick on dump No. 2 to a colored man who employs these helpers.

%™The bones go to Darling & Co.; the metals of various kinds to a junk
dealer on Maxwell Street, near Canal; bottles other than those belonging to
Borden and Bowman to another junk dealer. Those concerns buy back their
own bottles.

38 While this study was being prepared a policeman was placed on dump No.
2 who prevented women and children from going on that dump. From ten to
twenty women and from forty to sixty children seemed a fair estimate of the
number commonly found there.

No attempt is made to discuss the desirability or possible
economy of other methods of waste disposal. This reference
to the city dumps has been made because in presenting an account
of housing conditions in this neighborhood it seemed important
to call attention to this great stretch of territory, once like “the
yards,” a remote rural tract, now surrounded by dwellings, and
yet devoted in part to the disposal of decaying organic matter.
In spite of foul odor, heavy clouds of dust, and dreary ugli-
ness, women who hope to add to their meager supply of furni-
ture and fuel, are tempted to search here, and children who grow
accustomed to these conditions find here their adventure and their
play.

In conclusion it should be pointed out that the purpose of
this study is to set out conditions as they exist in the Stockyards
district in selected groups of typical blocks. This is, however.
only one section of a large inquiry and the significance of the
facts presented will be discussed later in comparison with those
collected for other portions of the city. No attempt has been
made here to discuss theories of sanitation, new standards of
city housing, model dwellings, or any one of a large number of
interesting aspects of the housing problem. The aim has been to
set forth a collection of facts regarding housing conditions in this
one neighborhood. It has been found that in many instances peo-
ple are living and sleeping in shockingly overcrowded rooms, that
in many cases the rooms are dark and ill-ventilated, that there is
a demoralizing lack of privacy, and that toilet accommodations
are often disgracefully inadequate. Many of the conditions
found are such as have been already condemned by the com-
munity and supposedly abolished. In 1901, the Report of the
City Homes Association set forth so forcibly the need of housing
reform that a new tenement ordinance was passed which it
was hoped would correct many of the evils then shown
to exist. Such a result could be accomplished, however, only
by the provision of a large and expensive staff of intelligent in-
spectors, and no adequate appropriation has ever been given to
the department entrusted with the enforcement of the law. It
is, therefore, not an indictment of the Health Department but
of our niggardly public policy in failing to make the appropria-
tions for adequate enforcement, that so many violations of the
law are possible; that 1,459 rooms were found under 70 square
feet in area, the minimum size now prescribed; that 935
rooms were found under 8% feet high, the minimum height
now prescribed; that in 372 rooms the window area was less
than 10 per cent of the floor area, the standard set for new
houses ; that 36 windowless rooms were found, and that 81 other
rooms were practically windowless, since the windows instead
of communicating with the outer air merely opened into another
room; that 1,616 dark and gloomy rooms were found; that in
1,119 out of 1,616 apartments, the families had no private toilet
facilities; that 1,981 sleeping-rooms were crowded beyond the
legal maximum which prescribes 400 cubic feet of air for
every adult and 200 cubit feet for every child under twelve.

When the New York Tenement House Commission com-
pleted its work and made its report, the result was the creation
of a tenement-house department, with a large staff of inspectors
whose entire time is given to tenement-house work. In the
year 1909, the city of New York spent $800,000 and employed
350 inspectors for the proper enforcement of its tenement-house
law. In Chicago there is no separate department, and during
the year 1909-10, the chief sanitary inspector had 78 inspectors
and $110,000 for all inspectional purposes. The creation of a new
department in Chicago may not be thought advisable, but there
can be no sound reason for failing to provide our present sani-
tary department with a very greatly increased staff. A well-
known expert has said recently that housing laws are not self-
operative. “Housing evils will not vanish of their own accord.
The causes which have led to them are too deep-seated to permit
anything so simple.” When the community conscience has been
sufficiently aroused to demand changes in the content of the law,
it seems little short of dishonest not to make possible its en-
forcement. To substitute the shadow for the substance in deal-
ing with the problem of city housing leads quickly to criminal
neglect.
