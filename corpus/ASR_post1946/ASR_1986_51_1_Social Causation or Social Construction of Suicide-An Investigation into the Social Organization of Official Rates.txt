In this paper, we integrate two vital but independent avenues of research on suicide.
Quantitative studies in sociology, using official statistics to test hypotheses, focus on
the effects of urbanization, religious affiliation and other reasons why individuals
commit suicide. Observational studies examine legal, organizational and
professional factors that lead to misclassifying suspicious deaths, but they fail to
consider their effects on the causes of suicide. Surprisingly, no study has examined
whether the social construction of rates biases attempts to test sociological theories
of the cause of suicide. We attempt to bridge this gap by organizing criticisms of
suicide rates theoretically, framing them in a measurement error model, and
introducing a number of techniques to control for misreporting and “correct’’ official
rates. Using several independently collected data sets for county groups (N= 404) in
the United States for 1970-71, we find that systematic misreporting exists. However,
misreporting in the official statistics has little discernible impact on the effects of
variables commonly used to test sociological theories of suicide. Our results suggest
a number of theoretical refinements necessary for pursuing further quantitative and
qualitative studies of suicide.
bias is an interesting sociological phenomenon
in itself, the social construction view and its
proponents argue that misreporting prevents
the discovery of the true social correlates of
suicide. According to Baechler (1973), the use
of rates hinders an understanding of the mean-
ing behind suicide. Because rates are socially
constructed, any study using official statistics
is viewed, at best, with a modicum of suspi-
cion. Yet there is no empirical evidence to date
to either support or deny these propositions. In
practice, investigators interested in the social
causes of suicide either overlook or explain
away methodological problems in using official
statistics. Of the many studies uncovering offi-
cial misreporting (e.g., Barraclough, 1972),
none has explored the impact of misreporting
on the analysis of the social causes of suicide.
To this point, no study has demonstrated that
the social construction of rates distorts or does
not distort the analysis of the social correlates
of suicide. As such, Hindess (1973) points out
that official rates can neither be accepted as a
“given” nor dismissed as inadequate until rates
themselves are analyzed to determine their
value in testing sociological theories of suicide.

Drawing from studies on the social processes
influencing official statistics and sociological
research on legal systems and organizational
structure, we lay out possible confounding in-
fluences and attempt to outline why social fac-
tors impinge on the recording of suicide. From
sociological theories on the causes of suicide,
we gather a list of possible social correlates.
Suicide as a word and as a classification of
death is problematic. There is general agree-
ment that suicides occur when people are the
willful agents of their own death. The process
of determining whether this statement cor-
rectly describes any one death lacks the
simplicity with which the words can be trotted
out one after another in such a forthright man-
ner. Few people who willfully terminate their
lives express an intention to do so, particularly
in writing. This has led many who study suicide
to dwell on lengthy discussions of what suicide
is (e.g., Durkheim, 1951 [1897]), while others
abandon hope of meaningful analysis (Douglas,
1967).? As early as the thirties, Zilboorg (1936)
questioned the analytic use of statistics. While
there is general agreement that the suicide rate
is underreported, estimates vary. Dublin (1963)
suggests that rates are underestimated by
25-33 percent, while Seger and Flood (1965)
claim that the true figure may be as much as 50
percent higher.

It is helpful to distinguish among three kinds
of errors which may be associated with official
statistics: random error, uniform underreport-
ing, and systematic misreporting.* With purely
random error, any individual death may be
misclassified but there is no pattern to the mis-
classification. On average, random error
should lead to as many false suicides as unre-
ported true suicides. In this case, there should
where S is the probability of suicide, X; is the
social correlates and a; is constants. If 30
percent of all suicides are underreported, the
mean value of S* the observed rate, would
equal 70 percent of the true S. Substituting the
observed S* into the above equation would
cause all of the observed coefficients to be 70
percent of their true value. All coefficients
would be affected in the same proportion.
Comparisons among coefficients would conse-
quently remain valid even though the absolute
levels of all the coefficients are too small.*
Uniform underreporting does not prevent the
testing of sociological theories of suicide using
official rates although it raises questions about
the magnitudes of the effects.

Systematic misreporting, in contrast, could
obfuscate the true relationships between
suicide rates and social causation factors.
Here, the probability that a suicide is mis-
reported varies consistently with social con-
struction factors. The ratio of true rates to offi-
cial rates will be consistently correlated with
observable characteristics such as the religious
character of an area and the nature of
medicolegal systems responsible for classifying
deaths. Failure to correct for these biases
could lead analysts to incorrect conclusions
about the role of social causation factors. For
example, if areas with a large percentage of
Catholics successfully hide suicides, a simple
correlation between official rates and the per-
cent Catholic might suggest that Catholic areas
discourage individuals from taking their own
lives. Systematic misreporting could lead to
this empirical finding even if the true effect of
living in a Catholic area is to increase the prob-
ability of suicide. Concerns of this type are at
the heart of social construction theories and
the problems of using official rates.Con-
sequently, we focus upon systematic mis-
reporting in the remainder of our analysis.
First, we discuss the possible sources of sys-
tematic error mentioned in the litera-
ture. Second, we review the social corre-
lates of suicide found in sociological work. We
then present three methods to mitigate the ef-
fects of expected misreporting. Finally, we em-
ploy each of these methods using county group
data for the United States in 1970 to examine
the impact of social construction factors on the
attempt to uncover the social causes of suicide.

Sources of Systematic Error. Legal statutes
do not clearly define suicide. Further, coroners
and medical examiners are not guided by the
kinds of definitions that social scientists pose
in treatises on suicide (De Castro, 1968; Gibbs,
1961; Nelson et al., 1978). Uncertainty per-
vades the classification of suspected suicides.
Some suicides may be misclassified because
the suicidal nature of the death is undetectable.
While unexplained sudden deaths usually re-
quire investigation, deaths resulting from
medical complications of earlier suicide at-
tempts or self-destructive acts (e.g., refusing to
eat) seldom do. These incidents of “indirect
self-destructive behavior,” “hidden suicides”
or “sub-intentioned death” escape classifica-
tion as suicides (see Nelson and Farberow,
1980; Simpson, 1950). Still other suicides es-
cape classification because they fit neatly into
more “objective” categories. Suicides can be
masked in any other cause of death, but previ-
ous research points out prime candidates:
single car fatalities (Huffine, 1971; Phillips,
1982, 1977; Simpson, 1950; Tabachnick et al.,
1973), accidental deaths such as poisoning or
overdoses (Baker, 1971; Barraclough, 1974;
Freidman et al., 1973; Oliver and Hetzel, 1973;
Ovenstone, 1973) or deaths from undetermined
causes (Barraclough, 1972; Farberow and
Shneidman, 1961; Litman, 1963; Murphy,
1979).§

The recording of suicides is complicated by
two suspected sources of systematic reporting
error: 1) concealment by social groups who
vary in their condemnation of suicide, and 2)
misclassification by coroners and medical ex-
aminers who vary in their attitude towards a
suicide verdict, in their qualifications to judge a
cause of death, and in the resources available
to conduct their investigations. Durkheim dis-
misses earlier claims on the informal control of
the religious community: “Once suicide was
thought only a simple civil wrong committed
against the State; religion had little or no inter-
est in the matter” (1951:334). However, others
contend that religion does influence the re-
porting of suicides (Douglas, 1967; Farberow et
al., 1977). Certain religious groups look upon
suicide as a disgrace and exert control by de-
nying religious benefits such as funeral rites
and burial space (Noyes, 1970; Ovenstone,
1973; Weiss, 1964). Catholics, traditionally,
have low reported suicide rates but are sus-
pected to be among the groups most likely to
hide suicides. Given this situation, previous
empirical research relating religious affiliation
and suicide may test a social causation hypoth-
esis that suicide varies with societal integration
(e.g., Durkheim, 1951 [1897]; Pope and
Danigelis, 1981; Stack, 1983). It may, on the
other hand, test an alternative: suicide varies
inversely with social condemnation of suicide
(Gibbs, 1961).

Since the task of classifying deaths defies
straightforward categorization, we can expect,
according to Perrow (1972:166), an absence of
routine bureaucratic structure. In addition,
while deaths are certified through a national
vital statistics registry in the U.S., responsi-
bilty for classifying cause lies with the states.
As a result, a complex variety of systems
exists. These can be characterized as either
centralized at the state level (e.g., New
Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island) or county level
(e.g., Utah, Montana, Massachusetts); as de-
pendent on physicians (e.g., Virginia, Arizona)
or on people from diverse backgrounds (e.g.,
Nebraska’s county coroners are court attor-
neys, Wyoming’s are morticians, Nevada’s are
justices of the peace). In some states, coroners
or medical examiners are full-time employees
(e.g., Alabama, Missouri) while in most states
they are part-time and often paid by the case
(e.g., Kansas and Pennsylvania). Even within
states there is diversity: larger counties in
California have medical examiners with their
own lab facilities and a full compliment of staff
while the smaller counties depend on elected
sheriffs serving ex-officio.®

As in the case of police responding to a call,
officials involved in classifying deaths are ac-
corded a great deal of discretion.” Any legal or
organizational factor influencing the discre-
tionary power accorded to the coroner or
medical examiner affects the suicide rate as
well. Medicolegal offices, as part of a discre-
tionary subsystem, depend on the particular
“facts” surrounding an individual death and on
the formal and informal social control mech-
anisms in operation (Reiss, 1971). In the ab-
sence of routine, scientific procedures which
can provide “objective” evidence to classify a
death as a suicide (e.g., autopsies), officials are
not likely to record a “borderline” suspicious
death as a suicide. Stigma on the family, politi-
cal pressures, or practical considerations of in-
surance compensation may predispose coro-
ners and medical examiners to avoid the
classification of suicide.

Legal statutes exert formal control over dis-
cretion by determining critical features of the
social processes of classifying deaths. State
statutes currently produce three types of sys-
tems: medical examiner systems, a few
coroner systems and a majority of hybrid
systems where both types exist concurrently in
one state. States with medical examiner sys-
tems are required to employ only M.D.s often
with specialized training in pathology. Previ-
ous research indicates that the background and
training of these officials affects the construc-
tion of official rates (Johnson, 1969; Nelson et
al., 1978; Turkel, 1953). Clarke-Finnegan
and Fahy (1983:386) claim that “The clinical
approach always finds more suicides than le-
galistic methods of coroners’ courts because
the former tend to depend on the balance of
probability, while the latter are constrained by
the need for more or less unequivocal evi-
dence.”’ In our terms, laws which require sci-
entifically trained personnel decrease the dis-
cretion of the coroner or medical examiner by
introducing “objective” scientific means of
determining whether or not a suicide has oc-
curred.

In addition, legal statutes outline the way a
coroner or medical examiner comes to hold
office. Elected officials are suspected of being
more attuned to powerful community interests
while appointed officials are more “removed
from partisan politics” and oriented toward
“objective” evidence (Kornblum and Fisher,
1972:i). This suggests that elected officials
exert more discretion in their job than ap-
pointed officials. If this is the case, we should
expect that counties with elected officials hesi-
tate more often in reporting suicides. Legal
statutes can attenuate the coroner's power to
call an inquest, either by dismissing this proce-
dure as acceptable procedure or by granting
this authority to attorneys (as in Michigan or
Massachusetts). The discretion of the coroner
to draw out the determination of death or to
rely on nonscientific sources of evidence may
result in a lower suicide rate. Denying that
option decreases discretion and the likelihood
of reporting error. Legal statutes vary and, as a
result, so does the discretionary power of offi-
cials who determine the cause of death—at
least in theory. However, as Simon (1957)
points out, organizations also control the
premises of decision-making. Coroner and
medical examiners are quick to point out that
the authority and responsibilty granted in legal
statutes are often not matched with necessary
financial and technical resources.* The
availability of toxiocology and pathology
facilities, for example, shifts the premise for
decision-making to more scientific criteria. The
absence of routine analyses of this sort have
been suspected in lowering detection of
suicides in borderline cases (Johnson, 1969).

These theoretical issues can be formalized in
the following measurement model. The true
suicide rate, P, is a function of the social cor-
relates, a vector Z:
Factors which increase the discretion of
coroners and medical examiners (i.e., coroner
systems, elected status, ability to call an in-
quest) result in a lower reported suicide rate.
Legal and organizational factors decreasing
discretion (i.e., medical examiner systems, ap-
pointed status, high availability of toxicology
and pathology facilities) increase the reported
suicide rates.

The Social Causation of Suicide. The range
of explanations for suicide is far greater than
what we will concern ourselves with here.
Sociological theories emphasize similar causal
mechanisms: when the rhythms of social life
are disturbed, suicides increase. Both the gen-
eral social condition of the population and spe-
cific disruptions in social relations take prece-
dence in sociological approaches (Lindsay,
1973). Specifically, sociological theories posit
the importance of factors such as urbanization
(Halbwachs, 1930), social status (Henry and
Short, 1954; Morselli, 1882; Powell, 1958;
Schmid and Van Arsdol, 1955), unemployment
(Brenner, 1973; Sainsbury, 1955), irreligiosity
(Masaryk, 1970), social disorganization (Port-
erfeld, 1952a; Sainsbury, 1955; Schmid, 1928),
secularization (Porterfeld, 1952b), crises
(Gibbs and Porterfeld 1960), the status integra-
tion of the population (Gibbs, 1961; Gibbs and
Martin, 1974) and social integration/regulation
(Durkheim, 1951 [1897]).°
Data. Since no single data set exists which
includes the information necessary to examine
the models above, we have compiled and inte-
grated several large bodies of data for this
analysis. Death rates from specific causes were
constructed by combining the 1970 mortality
tape from the National Center for Health
Statistics with the 1970 Census Public Use
Sample. We included only white adults in this
analysis because death rates by cause for
blacks are often unreliable and because small-
scale preliminary studies indicate that record-
ing suicidal death particularly for blacks is
problematic (Orcutt et al., 1977; Warshauer
and Monk, 1978). Cause-specific death rates
were constructed for each county group in the
U.S. for eight separate demographic cate-
gories: women 18-24, men 18-24, women25—44,
men 25-44, women 45-64, men 45-64, women
over 65, and men over 65. The county group
(N=404, excluding Alaska and Hawaii) is a
U.S. Census aggregation unit which combines
adjacent counties into population groups of at
least 250,000. We used information on the
death rates of individuals from suicides, car
accidents, all other accidents, undetermined
causes, homicide and physical illness.!°

We chose the county group level as our unit
of analysis for both theoretical and method-
ological reasons. The county group is the
smallest geographical level for which the Cen-
sus Bureau will release detailed information on
individuals (to protect confidentiality). While it
might have been feasible to gather additional,
more detailed information on suicide victims,
the same information would have had to be
obtained for the comparison groups (i.e., all
those who died in 1970 or, in some cases, all
individuals in the population). Finally, we do
not expect that the aggregation of counties into
county groups hides a great deal of within-
county variation. The Census Bureau cutting
point of 250,000 individuals results in the fol-
lowing type of aggregation: urban counties
usually form separate county groups, suburban
counties are sometimes combined with other
suburban counties and rural counties are often
aggregated together. We expect, then, a fair
degree of homogeneity in the county group
since the aggregation procedures do not lump
together vastly diffrent types of places.

We coded information on legal statutes and
organization of coroner or medical examiner
offices from a comprehensive report describ-
ing ‘‘medicolegal investigative systems”
(Kornblum and Fisher, 1972). This report
classifies each state system (coroner, medical
examiner or “‘mix’’) as it existed in 1971, out-
lines the selection process for officials, and
provides additional information on the
availability of resources (e.g., pathology or
toxicology facilities). Further, any variation in
specific counties or cities is reported. For
example, in Nebraska, only counties with over
125,000 inhabitants (i.e., Dodge and Lancaster)
have an available coroner’s physician and
pathologist. In Florida, a 1970 act required the
establishment of a medical examiner system,
but, for all practical purposes, only Dade
county had made the change-over by early
1971. We are able, then, on a county-by-county
basis, to correctly code counties which di-
verged from the state system. The Kornblum
and Fisher report covers all states and is fairly
uniform in the information provided. In a few
cases, where there was no description of avail-
able resources, we assumed that they were not
readily available.

We constructed variables indicating 1) the
type of systems classifying deaths (e.g., per-
centage of the county group population served
by a medical examiner system), 2) how the
officials come to hold office (e.g., the percent-
age of the county group population with an
elected coroner or medical examiner), and 3)
what facilities are available to them in the
course of an investigation (e.g., the percentage
of the county group population served by an
official who has the authority to call an inquest,
to easily access the services of pathologists, or
to have toxicology facilities provided either lo-
cally or by the state). Since one county, the
capital or largest city, is likely to have
classified the most deaths and have better
facilities, we constructed the coroner/medical
examiner variables to represent the percentage
of the county group population covered, for
example, by a medical examiner system. A
complete and specific list is provided in Ap-
pendix I.

We culled independent variables for the so-
cial correlate controls from a variety of
sources. Indicators for etiological factors in
suicide (e.g., social disorganization, social
status) come from the 1970 Public Use Sample.
Adult observations are aggregated in two
ways. Cell-specific variables, characteristics
descriptive of each age—sex grouping (e.g., the
percent of women 18-24 who have never been
married) are matched with each age-sex cell
for every county group. County group vari-
ables describe the entire county group (e.g.,
the percent of people in the county group who
have never been married). This is not equiva-
lent to having individual and contextual infor-
mation. Rather, we have information at two
distinct levels of aggregation, one which is
tailored to the age and sex composition of the
analytic group, and the other which is charac-
teristic of the county group. This procedure
allows us to separate out how the suicide rate
of all white males, age 25-44 for example, is
affected by the marital status of their age—sex
cell as opposed to the marital status of all
adults in the county group.'!
We matched information on the county
group’s religious profile to each of the age-sex
groupings. Data on the percentage of the total
religiously affiliated population of each county
group that are Catholic or Protestant come
from a 1971 National Council of Churches
study (Johnson et al., 1974). The information,
originally provided by county, is aggregated to
county group levels. Data on the number of
Jewish temples and their membership is
adapted from the American Jewish Yearbook
(1977). National Jewish Census figures are re-
corded 1) by city for cities with more than 500
Jews and 2) by state. This information was
matched to the appropriate counties and aggre-
gated to the county group level. The city in-
formation was assigned to the corresponding
SMSA, and where no other information was
available, the statewide average was used as an
estimate.'?

This variety of indicators gives us leverage in
measuring the social correlates. High divorce
rates and migration rates describe what Port-
erfeld (1952a) characterizes as disorganized
areas and also provide indicators of economic
and social ‘‘rifts”. The strength of social ties, a
component part of Gibbs and Porterfeld’s
(1960) thesis and Durkheim’s (1951 [1897]) reg-
ulation hypothesis, is reflected in religious af-
filiation, divorce, marriage, migration and age
(the latter implies the potential for contact and
friendship). All of the unemployment vari-
ables, education, income and the cost of living
index provide indicators of integration (Durk-
heim 1951 [1897]; see Appendix I for complete
list).

Analytic Methods. We test our hypotheses
about the effect of misreporting upon the social
correlates of suicide by comparing four dif-
ferent equations. In the first, the effect of so-
cial correlates on suicide is explored with no
attempt to correct for misreporting. In the re-
maining three equations, we try three different
methods to control statistically for systematic
misreporting. By comparing the controlled
versus the uncontrolled coefficients of the so-
cial causation variables, the first hypotheses
(Hija and H,») are tested. In controlling for mis-
reporting, we also test the second hypothesis
(H,) concerning the effect of social construc-
The basic social correlate model of suicide
(1) is assumed to have the following form: The
dependent variable, P,* is the official suicide
rate (i.e., the total number of suicides in each
cell divided by the cell population). The inde-
pendent variables include a set of cell-specific
characteristics (the X,;’s), a set of county group
variables (Y,, Y2, Y3... Yn), a set of religion
variables (R,, Ro, Rs ... Ry) and an average
error term. Observations are weighted by the
square root of the county group population N
in order to correct for heteroscedasticity.'>

To estimate the parameters of the model, we
use ordinary least squares regression. The
analysis is done within age and sex categories
to allow for the possibility of multiple causa-
tion (i.e., social groups may have high or low
suicide rates for different reasons; see Gibbs,
1961). Separate analysis of each age and sex
cell not only captures the mean differences in
suicide rates, but also reflects the interaction
between age and sex, on the one hand, and the
explanatory variables, on the other. This equa-
tion is fit to each of the age and sex groups of
white adults. A number of regression models
are estimated for each cell to examine the sen-
sitivity of each coefficient to different specifi-
cations and to see if a more limited regression
specification is appropriate. The full set of
variables considered is listed in the Appendix.
The actual values of coefficients in the reduced
models reported change little from the fuller
models, indicating that multicollinearity was
not a problem (although the significance levels
changed as expected).

In the final table, we report the unstan-
dardized regression coefficients and their
standard errors (in parentheses). We compare
both individual and groups of coefficients
across specification to examine their signifi-
cance. For example, we compare the individual
t-test for education across specifications to see
whether it changes across our control strate-
gies. In addition, we use an overall F-test to
see whether the set of social causation effects
change in comparison with the uncontrolled
model. Finally, we do an overall F-test of the
set of social construction factors to see
whether, as a group, they add to the overall
explanatory power of the model. The overall
F-tests are reported in Appendix I.

We use three strategies to control for sys-
tematic misreporting. In the first approach, we
estimate a regression equation (2a) directly
using ordinary least squares. To the extent that
the factors, Z, describe why some officials fail
to report suicides, these variables statistically
control reporting bias and permit a test of the
first hypotheses. The second hypothesis (H»)
can be examined directly as well (i.e., through
the significance of the coefficients in M). The
major drawback with the single equation model
involves the effects of any variables which
serve both as a social construction (X) and
social causation (Z) factor (e.g., religion). The
single equation approach can only estimate
their joints effects (M + A). Hypotheses about
misclassification (M) or the social correlates
(A) cannot be tested for these variables.

For the remaining tests, we take advantage
of our information about the other causes of
death. We assume that the true mortality (Po)
from other causes of death is a function of a
vector of variables, W, which might vary by
the specific cause of death:
Because P,* contains misreported suicides, it
controls for the variation due to misreporting.
The approach also separates the effect of vari-
ables which are in both X and Z (the coefficient
of the social correlate, Z, reflects only the so-
cial correlate effect, not the misreporting ef-
fect). -

There are major disadvantages with this sec-
ond technique, however. Since the actual
other causes of death are included in the re-
gression, E, enters as part of the independent
variables Po*. Because E, is negatively corre-
lated with E,, this violates one of the basic
assumptions of the Ordinary Least Squares re-
gression model. The independent variables
must be uncorrelated with the error term E,.'4
The coefficients of the regression consequently
could be biased. Second, this approach cannot
yield hypothesis tests about the cause of mis-
reporting (H.). Third, if true causes of other
deaths W are correlated with measured or un-
measured social correlates, it is possible that
deaths from other causes could serve as a
proxy for true causes of suicide (not merely
misreporting).

Our final approach employs two-stage least
squares both to control for misreporting and to
test hypotheses on the social construction of
rates (see Johnston, 1972:380). In the first
stage, the probability of death from other
causes is regressed on variables contributing to
the social construction of rates:
The first step regression ‘‘cleanses” the
mortality rates from other causes of the ran-
dom mismeasurement (E,) and variation in the
true rate that is not due to misreporting. We
want to remove E, which is negatively corre-
lated with E, and will lead to biased coeffi-
cients. At the same time, we want to leave the
systematic mismeasurement (MX) in the
analysis. When these cleansed rates of death
are entered in the suicide regression, they
serve as controls for systematic mismeasure-
ment. The two-step approach takes advantage
of information contained in the other causes of
death statistics. This is, in effect, an instru-
mental variable approach to Two Stage Least
Squares. This method also permits estimation
of the individual social correlate effect of the
variables which jointly enter the social con-
struction of rates and the social correlates.

All three of these approaches help to control
statistically for misreporting. Because of
omitted variables or improper functional form,
some misreporting may not be controlled. It is
also possible that some of the influence attrib-
uted to misreporting could be due to true un-
derlying social causes. However, since each
approach relies on such different assumptions
about the underlying model, it is unlikely that
all of the approaches fail to control for a sub-
stantial amount of misreporting. If critics of
official suicide rates are correct in asserting the
powerful influence of misreporting, the benefi-
cial effects of controlling misreporting out-
weigh any biases any of these three approaches
might introduce. We offer three cautions.
First, the findings apply to county groups and
may not hold for different units of aggregation
(e.g., counties or states) used in studies of the
causes of suicide in the United States. Second,
much greater differences exist in organizing
and regulating the system of death classifica-
tion cross-nationally than within the United
States. The impact of social organization on
the social construction of suicide rates among
countries thought to be culturally similar pro-
vide contradictory results. Coombs and Miller
(1975), for example, contend that ‘‘ascertain-
ment procedures” cannot account for the high
Table 1 presents the mean suicide rates and
their standard deviations for each of the eight
age and sex cells that form the basis for our
analysis. The differences are striking. The
suicide rate increases with age and is higher for
males than for females.

Columns 1 through 4 of Table 2 report the
results of several regression analyses for each
of the eight age and sex cells. We present the
unstandardized regression coefficients, their
standard errors (in parentheses), and asterisks
to indicate significance (alpha = .05, two-tailed
test). Other variables (listed in Appendix I)
were included but were dropped if they were
consistently insignificant and if they had no
effect on the coefficients presented here.

Column 1 represents the ‘naive’ model.
Only etiological or social causation factors are
included. Columns 2, 3 and 4 of Table 2 repre-
sent the result of our three different attempts to
control for misreporting. Any differences in the
coefficients of social correlates between Col-
umn I and Columns 2, 3 and 4 reflect bias from
systematic misreporting. The variables added
in these latter columns also provide informa-

of death (other accidents, car accidents and all
illnesses) are entered as control variables in
Column 3.!5 In half of the age-sex cells (fe-
males 65+ and all males under 65), the actual
mortality controls as a group are statistically
significant. Eight of the 24 individual coeffi-
cients of these variables are significant. Car
accidents are implicated, especially for men
(18-24, 25-44 and 45-64) and sometimes for
women (25-44); deaths from other illnesses
come into play only for the oldest group of
men; and other accidents matter for older
women (45-64 and 65+) and the youngest
group of men. These results support the notion
that suicides may be ‘“‘hidden” in other
categories such as car accidents and other acci-
dents. Interestingly, all of the significant coef-
ficients for the control mortality rates are posi-
tive in direction. Areas with high death rates
from car accidents, other accidents and all
illnesses also have higher suicide rates. The
social construction of rates, rather than
creating false differences across areas, actually
masks the true variation in true rates across
communities. Except for the effect of relative
income, we find little difference in the coeffi-
cients or in the significance of social causation
factors between Columns | and 3. Nor is there
a significant difference in the overall set of
coefficients between the two models for any
age-sex cell (see Appendix I). According to
this second test, official misreporting intro-
duces little bias in the attempt to uncover the
the social correlates of suicide.

The two-stage least squares estimation
(which takes into account official misreporting,
difficulties in detecting suicide, and conceal-
ment from religious groups) provides two sets
of results. In the first stage, other causes of
death are regressed upon the profiles of official
agencies and religious affiliation. These results
are reported in Table III. In all but 2 of the 24
regressions, the coefficients are significant at
the .05 level. Most of the significant individ-
ual coefficients lie in the “‘all illnesses” regres-
sion. This could be indicative of a widespread
tendency to code suicides as deaths from
illnesses. These results, however, would also
be expected simply from the statistical fact that
deaths from all illnesses occur more frequently
and, as a result, are more accurately measured
than mortality rates from car accidents or other
accidents. The medicolegal coefficients tend to
be statistically significant in these regressions
(49 of the 144 coefficients). The most consis-
tent effect is the presence of a local toxicologist
(significant in 17 cases). This increases the
mortality rate associated with all illnesses but
tends to decrease the mortality rate associated
with car accidents and other accidents. The
election of the local official tends to produce a
similar pattern in the coefficients. Finally, the
inquest variable tends to have the opposite ef-
fect. Because of these mixed findings, the re-
sults do not strongly support the expectation
that local toxicologists discourage misreporting
suicides while elected coroners and inquest
procedures encourage misreporting. The reli-
gious coefficients in Table 3 were significant
less often than the medicolegal coefficients
(only 18 of 96 are significant). The religious
coefficients for young men and women (18-24)
and old women tend to be negative (27 of the 36
are less than zero), but for older men and all
other women, they are positive (45 of the 60 are
greater than zero). These results suggest that
if religious variables are causing fewer suicides
to be reported, the effect is more pronounced
for men over 24 and middle-aged women
(25-64). Current social construction theories
do not specify why and for whom differential
effects of this type may occur.

The results reported in Table 3 form the
basis for computing the predicted rates of
death solely on religious and official agency
characteristics. The predicted rates are entered
as controls in Column 4 of Table 2. Five of the
24 coefficients of the predicted death rates in
Table 2 are statistically significant. As a group,
predicted death rates matter only for females
age 25-44 and males age 18-45. All five of the
significant individual coefficients are positive,
suggesting that areas with high official rates
may have higher, rather than lower, true rates.
This is contrary to social construction views.
The true suicide rate appears to vary even
more dramatically across county groups than
the official rates suggest. These results add
further support to our finding that area-wide
social causation effects may actually be under-
stated in empirical analyses of suicide.

Since different age and gender groups choose
different methods of commiting suicide, it may
be harder to distinguish suicides from acci-
dents. For example, young females (18-44) are
more likely to die from drugs, poisons or some
form of asphyxiation (gas, carbon monoxide)
while men (25—44, 65+) are more likely to die
from automobile accidents. Predicted mortality
from all illnesses is not significant in any of the
age-sex cells. Despite the evidence that sys-
tematic misreporting exists, the differences
between the official and the true rates do not
hinder attempts to detect the social causes of
suicide. The coefficients of the social causation
variables in Columns 1 and 4 of Table 2 tend to
be similar in size, sign and significance. As
we’ve seen in all but one case to this point, the
overall F-test does not support a significant
difference in the influence of social causes in
the “naive” and controlled models.

These results tell a consistent and robust
story across all three specifications. First,
where there appears to be a difference between
the “official” and the “true” suicide rates, the
latter fluctuate even more widely than the offi-
cial rates indicate. Second, although the char-
acteristics of the official agencies that certify
death are occasionally correlated with the offi-
cial suicide rate, these relationships rarely
have the expected sign. Third, social construc-
tion factors that shape the classification of sus-
picious deaths do not alter the substantive con-
clusions that one would draw from examining
the effects of the social causes of suicide alone.
Our results, then, are strong but they do not
support the standard positions on the social
construction of suicide rates.
Using three independent techniques, we ex-
amined whether the social construction of rates
confounds empirical attempts to discover the
social causes of suicide. Durkheim's original
suspicion that “our moral sensitiveness will
never be aroused by legislative measures”
({1897] 1951:371) finds only partial support in
our analysis. Suicides do, in fact, appear to be
consistently underreported, and this is related
to the legal and organizational character of
agencies responsible for classifying deaths. We
find, however, that misreporting has little ef-
fect on the relationship between suicide rates
and indicators of concepts in sociological
theories of suicide. Whether or not misreport-
ing is taken into account, the coefficients of
social causation factors have the same sign and
the same approximate magnitude. Despite the
fact that suicides may be unilaterally underre-
ported, we find that this makes very little dif-
ference in unraveling the fundamental causes
of suicide in the United States. The regularities
we observe attest to social events of a mag-
nitude great enough to survive rather than re-
sult from the social construction of rates (see
Hopperand Guttmacher, 1979). Misreporting, in
fact, rather than explaining all variation in offi-
cial rates from one area to another, actually
masks the true variation. The importance of
social factors may have been underestimated
by the use of official rates in empirical re-
search. Rather than dampening attempts to un-
cover the social causation of suicide, our re-
sults underscore the importance of pursuing
these sociological investigations.

Why do social construction factors fail to
influence official rates as expected? There are
two separate issues here: the lack of
significance of social construction factors; and,
more interestingly, results which are opposite
to the ideas developed in social construction
theories. Our findings, coupled with a re-
examination of reports on or by coroners de-
scribing actual judgements made, suggest two
theoretical ideas which may prove useful in
refining theories and in studies of official rates.

First, a consideration of cross-pressures may
explain either null or opposite findings and
provide an agenda for much needed observa-
tional studies of the social process of recording
official statistics. While coroners and medical
examiners acknowledge the subjectivity of
rulings on suspicious deaths, they offer a com-
plex version of how pressures from diverse
sources often work at odds. For example, Mur-
phy (1979), a pathologist and a coroner, reports
two types of cross-pressures in his observation
of an Ohio county: (1) those regarding the
trade-off between experience and caseload,
and (2) those from opposing parties with dif-
ferent levels of social power. Over time, he
observes that the number of undetermined
rulings for each physician-coroner remains
fairly constant. As officials gain greater experi-
ence in determining the cause of death, their
caseloads increase. These escalating demands
cancel out improvements in skills in detecting
suicides and produce a consistent performance

signify more consistent organizational pressure
to avoid the use of these residual categories.
Either null or contradictory findings could re-
sult from the operation of cross-pressures and
the differential power of opposing parties.
Second, the role of science needs to be more
fully explored. While sociologists and officials
alike argue that “scientific methods” uncover
more suicides than legalistic methods em-
ployed by coroners, two pieces of available
evidence suggest otherwise. Warshauer and
Monk (1978) studied the recording of suspi-
cious deaths in New York City before and after
the institution of the eighth revision of the In-
ternational Classification of Diseases. When
these medical examiners were given a new op-
tion to rule “undetermined” as a cause of death
under the revised ICD, the suicide rate
dropped dramatically (66 percent for blacks
and 50 percent for whites). In Murphy’s (1979)
study, one of the Ohio county physician-
coroners took a temporary leave to do a resi-
dency in forensic pathology. Upon his return,
the number of undetermined rulings made by
this physician doubled and remained relatively
constant at this new rate. Contrary to
common-sense expectation, then, the depen-
dence on “hard” evidence and objective proof
called for by the scientific method may actually
decrease the suicide rate. Coroners, depending
on a relative weighing of legal and medical
evidence, may actually have greater discretion
in ruling that a suspicious death is a suicide.
Coroners may overestimate the prevalence of
suicide, and given greater latitude, may report
too many suspicious deaths as suicides.

As Ahlburg and Schapiro (1984) remind us,
we can neither take for granted the supposition
that suicides reflect more than official pro-
cesses nor that the influence of social con-
struction factors are of the magnitude or type
suggested by these early theories. These re-
sults set out two tasks for social construction
approaches. First, social construction theories
need to be refined along the lines suggested
