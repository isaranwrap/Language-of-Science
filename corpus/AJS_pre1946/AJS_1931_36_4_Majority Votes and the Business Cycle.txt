MAJORITY VOTES AND THE BUSINESS CYCLE

ABSTRACT

Political opinion is guided by the belief that elections occurring in good business
years result in a demonstration of confidence in the party in power, while elections
occurring in depression years tend to turn the majority party out of office. A cor-
relation of the vote given to the party in power in about one hundred federal con-
gressional districts with selected points on the business cycle shows that when an elec-
tion follows a business expansion the party in power will receive a greater proportion
of the vote than when an election occurs in a period of severe business depression.
While the study substantiates political opinion, it also shows quite clearly that there
will always be a relatively large number of election districts that are apparently not
affected by changing business conditions.

It is pretty generally accepted that the popularity of political
parties at election time is related to business conditions. A party
which has been in power rejoices when the time for its retention or
rejection falls in a period of business expansion. On the other hand,
a majority party is seriously apprehensive of the outcome, and a
minority party finds cause for hope, when an election occurs during
a business depression. While there is undoubtedly a basis for these
fears and hopes, it would be interesting to measure to what extent
they are justified. One would like to know the answer to such ques-
tions as, “What proportion of the vote will the party in power re-
ceive when it goes into an election during a period of business ex-
pansion and what proportion in a period of depression?” Also,
“How many seats must the majority power expect to turn over to
its opponent when an election follows a period of business contrac-
tion?”

Mr. Stuart Rice has already shown that there is a relationship
here and has attempted to measure it. This paper attempts to find
another measure for data covering a wider area.

Rice constructed “cycles of party turnover’’ from the propor-

tion of the total vote which was given to the Republican candidate
in New Jersey assembly districts at forty-eight successive elections.
Correlating these cycles with a business curve after the manner de-
veloped by Ogburn and Thomas, Rice found that the rise and fall
of the popularity of the party tended to follow the rise and fall in
the business cycle. In good business years, the Republicans polled
a high proportion of the vote; while, in depression years, the same
party found its majority greatly reduced.

The method employed by Rice, known as correlation between
time series, has been used rather extensively of late to test the de-
gree of relationship between business cycles and cycles constructed
from certain social data such as marriage and divorce rates, crime
rates, birth- and death-rates, and so on. In each of these cases, the
series represent continuous data collected annually or even more
frequently. Election data, however, are not of this nature.

Elections are not continuous phenomena like marriages but sin-
gle events which occur at specified points in time. Moreover, ex-
tended series of election data are always colored by war periods,
third-party movements, and other special issues which constantly
change and the effects of which are not easily measured. Further-
more, we believed that if business conditions and party popularity
were to be studied together, the elections must have occurred during
or immediately following periods of expansion or depression, for a
remote issue is of little importance in swaying the electorate. Pros-
perity is readily forgotten in the face of depression, and the mem-
ory of depression is short-lived once recovery has set in. Now,
turning-points in business cycles may be several years apart; and
when they do appear, there is no assurance that it will be at election
time. Hence it is seen that to collect a series of coincidences be-
tween elections and turning-points in business cycles would be vir-
tually impossible.

Because of the impossibility of collecting a series of these coinci-
dences and because of the periodic nature of election data, we did
not conceive of the problem as a correlation between time series.
Instead, we decided to measure party popularity in a large number
of instances at a few elections selected because of their proximity to
turning-points in a business cycle. Instead of arriving at a single
value expressive of the degree of a long-time relationship between
party popularity and business conditions, we thought to observe the
fluctuation of the vote in a large number of electoral units at par-
ticular elections occurring at selected points on a business cycle.
We wished to discover, for example, what proportion of a large
number of congressional districts would retain the party in power
when the election occurred during a period of business expansion,
and in how many districts the proportion of the majority party vote
would be reduced when the election fell in a bad business year.

The first step in the solution of the problem was to secure a large
number of individual elections which covered a fairly wide area and
which occurred at frequent intervals. The elections for United
States Representatives seemed suitable.*

Following the choice of suitable elections, the next problem was
to select periods of business expansion and depression with which
the elections could be compared. The Harvard curve of business
activity plotted from quarterly data for the period 1875 to 1902
lent itself to the problem. The first and most pronounced period of
business expansion was from 1880 to 1882 and was followed by a
severe depression extending over the years 1883 to 1885, as is seen
in the reproduction of the curve in Chart I. An election was held in
1882, some time after the curve had reached its peak but while it
was still some distance above the zero ordinate. The next election
occurred in 1884, while business conditions, as reflected by the
curve, were at their worst. The opportunity presented itself, then,
for a study of an election held in a good business year and of an-
other election preceded by a prolonged business contraction.

While it was desirable to include as large a number of congres-
sional districts as possible, it was thought best, in order to secure a
homogeneity of election issues, to limit the area studied to the nine
industrial states of the Northeast. Local interest set them off from
the South and from the agricultural states of the West. The states
selected were New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Hamp-

* The elections in a single state or in divisions of a state were felt to cover too re-
stricted an area. The issues within states are generally of local interest, and hence the
elections in two or more states are not comparable. Presidential elections occur four
years apart and are usually complicated by special issues such as religion, woman
suffrage, and the prohibition question. Senatorial elections occur at irregular intervals
and are comparatively few in number.
HOW THE PERCENTAGE OF THE VOTE GIVEN TO THE PARTY IN
POWER WAS COMPUTED

The initial step in computing the percentage of the vote given to
the party in power was to tabulate the vote given to the candidate
of each of the two major parties and the total vote cast at each elec-
tion in each of the ninety-four congressional districts. The per-
centage of the vote given to the party in power was then computed
on the basis of the total vote cast. The party in power in any dis-
trict at the time of the election was, of course, the party which had
been successful at the preceding election.

For example, in 1876 the Republican party elected its candidate
in the First Pennsylvania District. In 1878 this same party re-
ceived 56.6 per cent of the total vote; and in 1880, still the party in
power, it received 57.1 per cent of the vote. The Republican party
also elected its candidate in the Seventeenth District of Pennsyl-
vania in 1876. In 1878, however, the candidate of this party re-
ceived only 45.2 per cent of the total vote and lost the election to

‘The number of districts varied somewhat due to the absence of contests in a few
of the districts now and then, and because of the redistricting following the taking of
the census in 1880. Districts affected were thrown out if they were no longer com-
parable. The election figures used in the study were taken from the files of almanacs
published by the Chicago Daily News, the New York World, the New York Tribune,
and the Brooklyn Eagle,
1878.° In 1880 it was 55.0 per cent, and so on in the four succeeding
elections. These percentages represented the movement of the vote
given to the party in power at six successive elections, and may be
regarded as a measure of party popularity. The average percentages
of the vote received by the party in power in the congressional dis-
tricts of the nine states and the averages for the entire area are
shown in Table I. Particular interest is attached, of course, to the
figures representing the elections of 1882 and 1884, the first of

*“Party in power” does not indicate a single party in a particular state, but the
particular party in each district which was successful at the election preceding the one
for which the percentages were computed. Thus the average vote of the “party in
power” in any state in 1882 represents the average of the percentage of the vote re-
ceived by each particular party which was in power in each district by reason of the
election of 1880. In most cases, both major parties are represented in the state
averages,
Proceeding from the corrected state averages shown in Table II,
the only problem remaining was that of bringing the nine series of
state averages into a composite representing the vote given to the
party in power in the entire area. This was done by computing the
percentages for each state as deviations from the straight-line trend
(method of least squares) and then expressing the deviations in
units of their own standard deviations. The data thus expressed
for the several states were weighted by the number of districts in
the states and averaged to get a series of single values for the area.
Table III shows the average weighted deviations of the proportion

* Corrected figures for the presidential years were obtained by multiplying the
percentage of the vote given to the party in power in each congressional district by a

number calculated to remove the effect of the presidential year. The nature of this
correction is given in the appendix to this article.

* No corrections necessary in 1878, 1882, and 1886.
The first year selected for comparison, it will be remembered,
was 1882, at which time an election occurred close to the peak in
the business cycle. An expansion period set in during the summer
of 1880, culminating in a peak in the fall of 1881. From a second
peak somewhat later, the line representing business activity de-
clined to a point well below the zero ordinate in 1884, in the fall of
which year the next congressional election took place. Here, then,
are two instances where elections were held just following extended
upward and downward trends in the curve of business activity.
What was the fortune of the party in power in each of the districts
and in the area as a whole as it went into the election in a year of
business prosperity, and what in the year of business depression?

An examination of Chart II shows that the proportion of the vote
given to the party in power was higher in the good business year of
1882 than at any other time during the period, and, further, that
the popularity of the party in power reached its lowest ebb in 1884,
the year of most marked business depression. Measured in units of
its standard deviation, the proportion of the vote received by the
majority party increased 5.7 units from 1880 to 1882 and fell off
4.9 units in 1884. Judging from these data, the party in power is
justified in anticipating victory when an election follows a period of
business expansion, and is rightly apprehensive when the election
falls in a depression year.

The relationship measured in this way is rather striking because
of the landslide majorities which carry along the districts that do
not follow the changes in business conditions. The change in party
popularity measured by the number of districts and states follow-
ing the business cycle is somewhat less convincing, yet still indica-
tive. In 1882, five of the nine state averages and fifty-four of the
ninety-four congressional district votes followed the movement of
business conditions. Two years later, five of the nine states and
forty-eight of the ninety-four districts again showed a relationship
between changing business conditions and party popularity. The
number of districts following the movement of business conditions
may be expressed as a percentage of the total number of districts
and the standard error of proportion computed. Calculated in

reduced the proportion of the vote given to the party in power. Ex-
pressed in percentages, 58.3--4.7 per cent in 1906 and 68.5-+4.5
per cent in 1908 of the congressional districts in the nine states
represented varied their support of representatives in the federal
Congress in accordance with the movement of general business
conditions.

We may conclude from this study, then, that party popularity
does vary with fluctuations in business conditions. When elections
occur during or just following periods of expansion, other things be-
ing equal, the party in power may expect a vote of confidence;
while on the other hand, when an election occurs in a depression
period, the majority party must expect to be shorn of its popularity
and even in some cases turned out of office. Moreover, it may be
concluded that the method of correlation adopted in this study is a
rough measure of the extent to which party popularity will vary.

While political opinion is correct in assuming that the party in
power will be less popular in depression years than at other times,
it should also be stated that the data show there will also be a num-
ber of districts that do not reflect the changes in business conditions.
There were forty districts in 1882 and forty-six in 1884 that did
not follow the movement of the business cycle.

It would have been desirable to test the validity of the conclusion
by the use of later years, but the war and the third-party move-
ment of 1924 were of too disturbing a character to permit. It may
perhaps be said, however, that the party in power had good reason
to be fearful of the result of the elections in the fall of 1930.
by the appropriate correctional factor, and finally a new state average was cal-
culated. An example follows.

The difference between the Republican vote in non-presidential and in Re-
publican presidential years was 51.0 per cent—47.9 per cent, or -++-3.1 per cent;
and the Democratic vote, — 0.5 per cent. In 1880 in the state of New York the
average percentage of the vote given to the party in power in the several dis-
tricts was 53.6 per cent. The correction factor was obtained by expressing
-+3.1 and —o.5 as a percentage of 53.6. The Republicans were considered to
have benefitted 5.8 per cent and the Democrats to have suffered to the extent
of 0.9 per cent because of the coincidence of a Republican presidential election
and the congressional election of 1880. The proportion of the vote received by
the party in power in 1880 in each district of New York was multiplied by 94.2
per cent when the party was Republican and by 100.9 per cent when it was
Democratic. The average proportion of the vote received by the party in power
in New York in 1880 was reduced in this way from 53.6 per cent to 51.1 per
cent.
