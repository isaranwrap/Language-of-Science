It is interesting to note that inventors played an important part
in all past wars. The Greeks, for instance, employed Archimedes
at the siege of Syracuse in devising new war inventions. During the
French Revolution the scientists and inventors were busy in devis-
ing methods of making guns, powder, swords, and bayonets. Dur-
ing the World War the scientists and inventors were mobilized as
they never were before.

“The sharp spur of necessity, felt by the Allies soon after the opening of
hostilities, drove them to the instant utilization of scientific research to make
good the losses caused by the restriction of imports. Optical glass for gun-
sights, range-finders and periscopes, chemicals needed for high explosives; and
scores of other products developed in Germany after long years of investiga-
tion were suddenly rendered inaccessible. Some of these could be manufactured
without much delay; but in many cases the necessary process was unknown
and could only be discovered by research. Investigators from the universities,
the industries and the technical schools were called upon for aid, and manu-
facture was soon rendered possible.”+
lost the hope that the war would be brought to a victorious termination over-
night by some marvelous new scheme springing full-fledged from a single
brain.”

Mr. Thomas Robins, who was in charge of the government Board
of Inventions which was operated by the naval Consulting Board
dealing with inventions of every kind, naval, military, and indus-
trial, states in a personal letter that about 110,000 alleged inven-
tions were examined.

Of this number one invention was accepted and utilized; one invention was
accepted and developed by the Government and money was appropriated for
its employment, but the armistice prevented its actual use. A third invention
was accepted and utilized by the Government for a purpose which was not con-
templated by its inventor. Several devices were developed by experienced
scientists to aid in the detection and location of submarines. They were em-
ployed successfully. This work was conducted by members of the Naval
Consulting Board and of the National Research Council. Undoubtedly other
inventions were submitted to the Government through other channels, but as
to the number of these or whether any of them were utilized I have no knowl-
edge. The extremely small percentage of useful inventions indicates that the
art of war is so old and its development under the stress of necessity has been
so complete that the ordinary untrained inventor is able to make no valuable
contribution.

There was also an unusually large number of patent applications
relating to war inventions filed in both the United States and Eu-
rope during the last war, clearly indicating that war is a powerful
stimulus to invention. The United States Patent Office does not
record the annual number of patents granted in the specific fields of
inventions, so that it was necessary actually to count the patents in
several classes of war inventions. The results are given in Table I.

The totals for all the classes of invention in Table I range in the
three hundreds from 1910 to 1918, but in 1919 there is a sharp rise
to 870 patents, which is almost three times greater than the normal
level. In 1920 there were 524 patents, which is also considerably
higher than the normal level. The United States entered the war in
April, 1917. This gave a great impetus to war invention, which
resulted in the filing of many patent applications in the Patent
Office. As it takes, on the average, about two years for a patent to
be examined and issued, the patents did not begin to be issued until

until April of that year. During the next year the number of patent
applications rose to nearly three and a half times the pre-war level.
The high level continued throughout the entire Civil War. In April,
1865, the Civil War ended and Table III shows that there was a
distinct drop in invention, especially in the second half of the year.

The accelerating effect of the Civil War on war inventions is also
shown in Table IV, giving the patents granted during 1860-65 for
cannons and firearms. Toward the end of the war there were al-
most twice as many patents granted as compared with the number
at the beginning of the war. Since there is a delay in the granting
of the patents due to the procedure in the Patent Office, the number
of patent applications filed (given in Table III) is a more accurate
index of the actual inventive activity during the Civil War.

War tends to accelerate the number of inventions in the type of
war implements which are used most. During the Civil War the
number of patent applications for cannons rose to almost seven

Although the total number of patents granted by England
dropped to about 4o per cent of the pre-war level during the war,
yet the total number of patents for the war inventions, given in
Table V, almost doubled above the pre-war level. This indicates
that there was a tremendous amount of effort exerted in these
classes of inventions. This inventive activity was so great as to
overcome not only the 4o per cent drop in the number of patents
but also to raise it to twice above its pre-war level. We must remem-
ber that the military draft took the men between the ages of eight-
een and forty, which are the years of the greatest inventive activity.
We should, therefore, find a drop in the total number of inventions
made during the war because many inventors were removed from
their normal inventive environment, and they could not possibly
invent at the battle front. This actually occurred in all the coun-
tries. In spite of the greatly reduced number of inventors left at
home, we find that the number of pre-war inventions relating to
war rose in England to twice its pre-war level. This means that the
civilian inventors left at home actually were much more active than
they would be normally in order to cause the increase in war inven-
tion shown in the tables.

The patent applications filed in the German Patent Office in sev-
eral classes of invention during 1910-23 also show the very decided
influence of war on invention as given in Table VI.

No patent statistics were published during the war, but it was
possible to calculate the average for the years 1915-18 from the
total in 1914 and 1923 given in Table VI. The data for this table
were taken from the Blatt fiir Patent, Muster und Reichenwessen
for 1914 and 1923.

Table VI shows that the war had a decided effect on the peace
industries such as music, beer, tobacco, sculpture, and dyes, which
dropped considerably below their pre-war level because they were
not essential. On the other hand, there was a great increase in the
number of applications for firearms and foods which were vital for
carrying on the war. The airships, ships, and chemical processes
show a decline, but they held their own fairly well, especially in
view of the great drop in the total number of applications filed dur-
ing the war, which showed a loss of almost two-thirds of the pre-
war level.

Practically every able-bodied man in Germany was engaged in
direct warfare. This means that nearly the entire population of in-
ventive age was removed from surroundings conducive to inventing.
Yet the total number of applications only dropped to two-thirds of
the pre-war level. This clearly indicates that the civilian population
left behind was inventive to an extraordinary and unusual degree
during the war.

A military environment is not conducive to invention. This is
clearly indicated by the data given in Table VII giving the number

of patents obtained by men in the United States Army and Navy
from 1910 to 1926.

Table VII shows that comparatively few inventions are made by
the men in the Army and Navy. In 1926 there were about 120,000
enlisted men in the Army and 95,000 men in the Navy, and only
eight patents were obtained by those men. Military life during
peace times is largely routine in character, lacking incentive and
competition of any sort. Naturally no inventions can be produced
under such conditions. Table VII shows a great increase in patents
during 1919 and 1920. This was obviously produced by the tre-
mendous increase of our military forces during the war, which ran
up to several millions.
Military men rarely invent basic war implements. They are
usually made by the peaceful civilian inventors. John Ericsson, for
instance, who invented the screw propeller of the warship “Prince-
ton” in 1841, was not a naval officer. This invention led to the in-
stallation of the engines and boilers below the water line, bringing
about the development of modern naval construction. Hiram Max-
im, the inventor of the machine gun, was not an army officer. Gat-
ling, the inventor of the important machine gun bearing his name,
was a real-estate dealer. Colt, who invented the Colt gun, was an
American who worked in his father’s textile mill. Dreyse, who in-
vented the needle-gun which was so effectively used by the Prus-
sians in the Franco-Prussian War, was a German locksmith and
manufacturer of ironware. Fulton, Bushnell, Holland, and Lake,
who made various submarine inventions, were outsiders to the
navy.

According to B. Brown,* great inventions produced in former
wars were rarely utilized or appreciated at the time, and many
years passed before they began actually to be used. David Bushnell
in 1777 made a submarine, but the government refused to be inter-
ested in it. He spent all his money on this submarine and almost
succeeded in blowing up a British ship. Fulton also received no
encouragement in his submarine venture. In 1814 his steam war-
ship “Demologes” was launched, but it was never used. Robert
L. Stevens spent about two million on an ironclad battery. It was
never finished on account of the many changes made by the Navy
Department. Two decades later the “Monitor,” built by Ericsson,
definitely proved that Stevens was right. Muzzle-loading muskets
were used during the greater part of the Civil War although the
breech-loading rifle was perfected before the war.
