On several occasions, Boudon (1972, 1973, 1975) has proposed that latent
structure models be developed for the analysis of mobility tables. Others
have alluded to a latent structure approach for the analysis of mobility
without actually bringing the general latent structure model into the
center of their mode of analysis (e.g., Bartholomew 1973; Goodman 1969;
Hauser 1978; Pullum 1975). This paper is a systematic attempt to model
mobility processes from the latent structure point of view. It is based for
the most part on methods developed in very different contexts by Goodman
(1974a, 19746, cf. Lazarsfeld and Henry 1968; Clogg 1977, 1979a, 19806).
These methods will be applied to classical data on intergenerational mobility
in Denmark and Great Britain to illustrate their utility in various kinds of
comparative analysis.

Section I defines the latent structure model, describes important deduc-
tions which can be made from it, and elaborates the substantive meaning
of model parameters in the context of mobility-table analysis. Analogies are
drawn between the latent structure approach and some approaches based
on other kinds of multiplicative models (e.g., models of quasi independence
or “quasi-perfect” mobility), between the latent structure approach and
certain regression approaches to analyzing the dependence of destination
on origin, and between the latent structure approach and certain Markov-
type models often used to examine the time dependence exhibited in the
transitions among statuses across time.
I. THE LATENT STRUCTURE APPROACH TO THE ANALYSIS OF
MOBILITY TABLES

The Latent Structure Model

Let mi; refer to the expected proportion in the (i, 7) cell of an J X I mobility
table, where i = 1,...,1;7 = 1,..., I. The row variable will refer to the
origin statuses (e.g., father’s occupational category) and will be denoted by
the symbol O. The column variable will refer to the destination statuses
(e.g., son’s occupational category) and will be denoted by the symbol D.
With 7,° = 2; w:; defining the marginal distribution of the statuses at the
time of origin, the mobility rates can be written as 7;; = mi;/7:°. Models
explicitly devised for the 7,; are also implicit models for the 7;;, and vice
versa, a fact to which I shall often refer. The categories of O and D are
deliberately referred to as statuses, that is, positions in social structure
broadly defined, although clearly in some cases this designation may not be
appropriate.

Since the origin status variable O is logically prior to the destination
status variable D, it is natural to attempt to characterize the variable that
intervenes between O and D. This intervening variable may be denoted as
X, and I hasten to-point out that X might actually be composed of several
variables, each one of which might be important in its own right as a
(partial) intervening variable. For the present argument, X will refer to
the composite representation of all intervening variables, a single variable
formed in an appropriate way by considering the joint variable with com-
ponents equal to each of the intervening variables. Standard methods imply
that, if X can be adequately specified and properly measured, the association
between O and D will disappear when X is “controlled.” This means that
the association between O and D would be nil in each conditional table
formed by taking the cross-classification of O and D at each level of X.

If X were observable and discrete, standard contingency-table methods
could be used to test whether X has been properly specified; an elementary
log-linear model (O X D|X) would be of interest. If O, D, and X were
quantitative and X were observable, standard methods appropriate for
linear models could be used instead. This type of analysis would focus on
the partial regression coefficient Bpo-x and would lead to the conclusion
that X is properly specified whenever 8po-x = 0. Yet another approach to
specifying the X variable which intervenes between O and D is the latent
structure approach on which this paper is based. Variables O, D, and X
will be regarded as discrete (note that O and D are always discrete in the
mobility-table context), but X will be conceived as “latent,” or inherently
unobservable. The latent structure approach is distinguished from a linear
model approach only by (a) positing discreteness for all variables and (5)
positing that the intervening variable X is latent or incapable of being
infallibly measured in a direct way. The latent structure approach allows a
characterization of the intervening variable X without bringing additional
information into the analysis, and characterizing this variable can be
viewed as the primary objective of this research.

Let us suppose that X has T categories; the categories of X will be
indexed by #, with ¢ ranging from 1 to T, and these categories are referred
to as the classes of X. The use of the term “class” is deliberate, just as the
term “status” was deliberately chosen to refer to the categories of O and
D. It will be seen later that the classes of X are, in general, mixtures of the
statuses of O and D. Certain sets of statuses will serve to define these
classes, though, strictly speaking, only in probabilistic terms. A major
objective of the analysis will be to determine precisely which sets of statuses
serve to define the respective classes of X. What is being suggested is that
the pattern of mobility observed in the O X D mobility table can serve to
define classes, or groups of statuses, within which the structure of mobility
takes on a special character. In most respects, this approach will define a
class of persons as a group which possesses random mobility chances with
respect to the statuses which together constitute the particular class. That
is, the absence of structured barriers to mobility among statuses within a
class is the defining characteristic of a latent class of individuals. The close
isomorphism between this statistical definition of a latent class and at
least some sociological concepts of social class is perhaps the principal
justification for the approach presented herein.

Let 7;°°¥ refer to the expected proportion in the (i, j, ¢) cell of the
indirectly observed O X D X X cross-classification. We assume that
then the following relationship will also hold:

min P® = eX my OX {PX , (2)
for all i, j, and ¢. In equation (2), w,* refers to the probability that a ran-
domly chosen member of the population will be a member of the ‘th latent
class, that is, the proportion of the population in latent class ¢. The parame-
ter 1:9* refers to the conditional probability that a member of the ith

latent class will have origin status i (for i = 1,..., I), and the parameter
j:>* refers to the conditional probability that a member of the ‘th latent
class will have destination status j (for 7 = 1,..., J). Equation (2) states

that O and D are conditionally independent, given the levels of X, as
should be the case if X intervenes between O and D. Note should be taken
of the meaning of the parameters on the right-hand side of (2) in the mo-
bility-table context: the 7,* provide the distribution of the classes indirectly
observed in the mobility table, and the 7;,°%, 1jPX describe the distribution
of the statuses within each class. Substituting (2) into (1) produces the
fundamental equation of latent structure analysis:
The proportion correctly allocated into the latent classes given a model for
the 7; is merely 1 — Ey. If the distribution of X were known in advance,
an unconditional assignment of individuals into the classes of X could also
be made. If #* were the class of X where 7;* is at a maximum, an assignment
rule similar to that discussed above would place all individuals in the
t*th latent class, irrespective of their mobility patterns. The expected
proportion of errors with this assignment would be

Ey = 1— Te®. (7)

A measure of association seems appropriate as an index of the degree to
which errors in predicting class membership are reduced when mobility
patterns are taken into account. A -proportional-reduction-in-error measure
consistent with the definition of Z; and E, above is the asymmetric \,

dx-op = (LE: — E)/Ey (8)

(see Goodman and Kruskal 1954). As suggested by Clogg (19796), these
measures can be of use in assessing the quality of a latent structure model
in terms different from usual criteria based on goodness-of-fit of the model
to data.

Returning now to the model parameters in (2), we note that 70% ap-
pears to be defined in a way inconsistent with the specification of X as an
intervening variable consequent to the origin status variable O, since it
defines the conditional probability that the antecedent variable O takes on
status i given that the consequent variable X is at level ¢ (i-e., class ¢). We
must quickly point out that X might actually be conceived as coexistent in
time with O, in which case this logical difficulty would be less important.
Or, perhaps more realistically, X could be conceived as containing com-
ponent variables, one or more of which are coexistent in time with O and
one or more of which are consequent to O. Whatever the interpretation
given to X (i.e., as coexistent in time with O, partly coexistent in time with
O, or entirely consequent to O), the important idea is that the 7;,¥ cannot
be interpreted as simple “recruitment” probabilities, as is customary with
the general latent structure model in many substantive contexts (cf.
Lazarsfeld and Henry 1968).

Let mi denote the conditional probability that a member of the ith
origin status will be in the éth latent class. Clearly, this can be written as

mit OX = 15% [m9 = 1 Xe X/ ms? « (9)
Now the mobility rates 7;; = 7,;/:° can be written as
r = =
1 = Dy ri F a; PX , (10)
t=1

using (9) and (3). Equation (10) says that the probability of moving from
origin status 7 to destination status 7 is the sum of the T probabilities of
Some Special Cases

Let us now consider some special cases of the latent structure model defined
in equations (1)-(3). First consider a model Hi where T = 1, implying
that m9 = 2, rj?¥ = 77”. In this case, (3) can be written as

wig = TOTP, (11)

demonstrating that H, is the hypothesis of independence between O and D,
usually described as a model of “perfect mobility.” It could be said that
Hy, posits the nonexistence of a latent class structure, since the ‘class
variable” X is degenerate, possessing only one class. Mobility is completely
random with Hi, depending only on the distribution of statuses at origin
and destination, and it is precisely this feature which demands that the
occupational statuses be interpreted as designating only one class. Random
mobility patterns imply that no structured barriers to mobility exist,
apart from those constraints implied by differences in the two relevant
status distributions. When the number of classes T is greater than one, a
class structure is posited to exist, and these cases are of most interest to
us here. If T = 2, for example, (3) would imply that within each latent
class mobility would be random, depending only on the marginal distribu-
tions of the statuses at origin and destination within each class (i.e., TiO,
1;2*), and a “class barrier” between two classes would be said to exist.
Consider next a model where T = I + 1 and where 7;,0% = 3,2¥ = 1,

fori = 1,..., I. Then (3) reduces to
ns = jr Haram ¥aj4P* , fori = 5, (12)
" mryx ms 41o*m; 4%, fori #7,
using the fact that 1X = 1>X = 0 when i ¥ t. The first J classes of X

are actually deterministic ‘ ‘status classes,” since the 7;*, fori —1,..., J,

Such a model was introduced by Goodman (1974a) in a very different
context and was designated a quasi-latent structure. For the model described
by (14), there are J deterministic status classes, where status inheritance
(or immobility) occurs with probability one. However, two classes of
“latent movers” are posited to exist (instead of just one class of latent
movers), and that is all that distinguishes this model from the quasi-
perfect mobility model. When considering the quasi-perfect mobility model
as applied to various sets of mobility data, Pullum (1975) found it necessary
to modify the model by allowing for deterministic classes of persons having
a characteristic form of mobility (e.g., mobility from status 1 to status 2)
in order to explain the clustering adjacent to the main diagonal in the
mobility table. The generalization of the quasi-perfect mobility model
suggested in the quasi-latent structure of (14) is to posit the existence of
two probabilistic classes of latent movers. It will be seen later that this
generalization of the quasi-perfect mobility model fits the data very well,
providing an adequate accounting for the clustering that is typically
observed on or adjacent to the main diagonal.

To draw out more fully the relationships between the quasi-perfect
mobility model and the quasi-latent structure model, let
II. UNRESTRICTED LATENT STRUCTURES

To my knowledge, latent structure models have not been previously applied
to mobility tables in published research (except for Clogg 19800), nor
have they been applied to analyze other kinds of two-way cross-classifica-
tions. However, no peculiar difficulties are encountered in applying latent
structure models to two-way cross-classifications like mobility tables, as
this section will demonstrate. Attention will be devoted here to unrestricted
latent structures for mobility tables with the objectives of demonstrating
the general approach just discussed, clarifying some identification problems
which arise, and presenting some of the deductions which can be made
from these relatively simple models.

them, have been analyzed so extensively that little comment about their
makeup is required.

The statuses in the 8 X 8 British table correspond to the following
occupational categories: (1) professional and high administrative; (2)
managerial and executive; (3) inspectional, supervisory, and other non-
manual (high grade); (4) inspectional, supervisory, and other nonmanual
(low grade); (5) routine grades of nonmanual; (6) skilled manual; (7) semi-
skilled manual; (8) unskilled manual (Miller 1960, pp. 70-72). For the 7 X 7
table published in Glass, status categories 5 and 6 were combined; and in
the 5 X 5 table given in table 1, status categories 2 and 3, status categories
5 and 6, and status categories 7 and 8 were combined. Svalastoga (1959) is
responsible for collapsing the British table into its 5 X 5 form; he did so to
make it more comparable to the Danish 5 X 5 table also reported in table 1.
These data thus allow two distinct types of comparative analysis: a direct
comparison of mobility structures in Denmark and Great Britain based on
the two 5 X 5 tables (assuming that the occupational statuses are com-
parable between the two tables) and a comparison of mobility structures in
a relatively coarse and in a relatively fine categorization of occupational
statuses for the same society based on the British 5 X 5 and 8 X 8 tables.
Special note should be taken of the zero count for the (5, 1) cell in the
British 5 X 5 table and of the zero counts in the (7, 1) and (8, 1) cells in
the British 8 X 8 table. These zero counts will require simple modification
of some of the latent structure models proposed herein.
calculated by using the L? of the baseline model of independence (namely,
the model of perfect mobility) as a measure of overall variability to be
accounted for and the L? of successive models as measures of residual
variability.

The one-class model presented in (12), equivalent to the hypothesis of
perfect mobility or independence, is denoted as Hi in table 2. The model
clearly does not fit well for any table, and judging from L*(H;) the British
data appear to depart most seriously from the prediction of H;. But the
British sample is 46% larger than the Danish sample, and upon multiplying
L*(H;) for the Danish sample by 1.46 (yielding 956.4) it is easy to see that,
contrary to the ordering of the unadjusted x? statistics, the Danish table
exhibits a more marked departure from the one-class model. It can be
noted that this feature of the data is exhibited clearly in the comparison of
A’s. Model Hi and the summary indexes associated with it are presented
here solely for purposes of gauging the improvement obtained by con-
sidering other models to be considered next.

The two-class latent structure model denoted by Hz provides a moderate
improvement over Hj for each set of data. The A’s range from 8.0% to
9.3%, and the R’s range from .73 to .82. (Here it can be noted that the R?
and A lead to slightly different interpretations of the degree of fit, since A
is the lowest [8.0%] for the British 5 X 5 table, but R? is the highest for
the Danish 5 X 5 table, even though neither R? nor A depends in a direct
way on sample size.)

A comment on the degrees of freedom associated with H2 is appropriate,
owing to the fact that the parameter estimates are not locally identifiable
(cf. Goodman 19746). In the 5 X 5 table there are 25 expected proportions
wiz, but one of these can be ignored, since 2,,;7:; = 1, giving a total of 24
nonredundant 7,,;’s. There are two latent class proportions m*, 2*, but
one of these can clearly be ignored, since 2:r;* = 1. There are 5 X 2 = 10
of the 7:%, but since 2,r,,2% = 1 we can ignore two of these (one for each
class t = 1, 2); similar logic shows that two of the ,:2* can be ignored.
These results seem to suggest that there are 24 — (1+ 8+ 8) =7 df for
Hp, but actually there are 9 df, and really only 15 (not 17) nonredundant
model parameters. Certain dependencies exist among the model parameters
other than those noted above, and unless two restrictions are imposed the
parameter estimates will be unidentifiable. The unrestricted model for the
5 X 5 table has 9 (not 7) df, and although the unrestricted two-class model
can be tested by comparing either X? or L? with the tabulated percentiles
of the x? distribution on 9 df, empirical deductions from the model such as
those presented in the formulae of Section I cannot be made unless restric-
tions are imposed to identify the parameter estimates.

The identification problem is depicted in the two sets of parameter
estimates appearing in table 3. Each set of estimates produces an identical
value of L?, but the estimates can be seen to differ somewhat from each
other. The set of estimates in part A corresponds to a solution obtained by
using one set of start values in the computer program described by Clogg
(1977), which employs the algorithm presented by Goodman (19746).

Different sets of start values will lead to different parameter estimates,
but the underidentification of parameters implies that there can be no
rational means of choosing among different sets of estimates so obtained.
The set of parameter estimates in part B was obtained by imposing two
restrictions, OX = FyOX = 0, and with these two restrictions the parame-
ter estimates are identifiable. An additional restriction can be enforced in
a new model, but such a restriction will lead to an increase in the value of
L?, and so only two restrictions are necessary for a “just-identified”’ solution.

In a situation where parameters are unidentifiable, strictly a priori
considerations must be used to construct plausible restrictions which render
the estimates interpretable. A rationale for circumventing the identification
dilemma is presented here; it exploits the fact that status 1 is the highest
and status 5 the lowest status in the table.* Consider the effect of restricting
OX = 0, which is equivalent to assuming a priori that ftn0* = 0. This
restriction says that the first latent class (where ¢ = 1) cannot contain
members from the fifth (the lowest) origin status category. Such a restriction
serves in part to characterize the first latent class; since persons in that class
cannot have been drawn from ie lowest origin status, it can be said that
class 1 of X corresponds to an “upper”? class. Consider next the effect of
restricting ROX = 0, equivalent to assuming a priori that 29 = 0. This
says that the second latent class cannot contain members from the first (the
highest) origin status, and so this type of restriction can aid in characterizing
the second latent class. Persons in that class can have been drawn only
from the four lower origin statuses, and this leads in part to designation of
the second latent class as the “lower” class. The model using both of these
restrictions produces the set of identified parameter estimates in part B of
table 3, and inspection of those quantities indicates the validity of charac-
terizing the classes as upper versus lower. The conditional probabilities
# are such that #.9% > #.°% for i = 1, 2, 3 and aX < #°* for
i = 4, 5, and an identical ordering is evidenced for the conditional proba-
bilities #;,2*. Since the two restrictions imposed in part B of table 3 could
have been based on an a priori conception of how the classes of X relate to
the origin status of the individual, and since these restrictions also serve to
identify the parameters, we are led to these estimates as a plausible descrip-
tion of the structure of mobility as rendered by the two-class model. It can
be noted that 38% of the persons are estimated to be in the upper class for
the Danish data, with 62% in the lower class. The relationship of the class
variable to both the origin and the destination status variables can be
studied by inspecting the corresponding sets of conditional probabilities
reported in table 3.

Although the two-class model H2 has not fitted the data to an acceptable

4 If we were not willing to assume that the highest and the lowest status in the table were
known a priori, different sets of restrictions would have to be used.

status 2 to 1, 2, 3, or 4; from status 3 to 1, 2, or 3; or from status 4 to 1 or 2
are all predicted to be members of the upper class. All others are predicted
to derive from the lower class. The indexes of the quality of this prediction
indicate that a reasonably good prediction is offered by the model (e.g.,
88.2% of the persons are correctly allocated into the latent classes under
the model).

Also presented in table 4 are the error rates associated with the assign-
ments for all 25 mobility patterns. It can be noted that these error rates
behave as could be expected if the model were substantively plausible, with
low error rates in the extreme upper left and lower right parts of the table
and higher error rates in the center of the table where latent class member-
ship is more difficult to determine. Within the mobility patterns which are
predicted to define the upper class, there is a nondecreasing trend in the
error rate associated with the prediction as one considers mobility patterns
downward from or to the right of the (1, 1) cell, with a similar comment
pertaining to mobility patterns above or to the left of the (5, 5) cell.

In equations (9)-(10), the mobility rates r;; were decomposed into a sum
representing the Markov character of the latent class model. A display
like that in figure 1 can summarize the results effectively, with the transition
rates entered on the arrows in a kind of flow graph or path diagram. A
further consequence of the identifying restrictions used for the two-class
model can be seen in figure 1; the transitions from origin statuses 1 and 5
are deterministic in character, since a person in origin status 1 moves to
latent class 1 with certainty, and a person in origin status 5 moves to
latent class 2 with certainty.

The two-class model H2 was also applied to the British data. For the
British 5 X 5 table, it has been noted that there is a zero count in the (5, 1)
cell, and in the British 8 X 8 table it has been noted that there are zero
counts in both the (7, 1) and (8, 1) cells. Upon applying to the British
5 X 5 table the same zero restrictions used to identify the parameters of H2
for the Danish table (i.e., 751°¥ = m»°* = 0), it was found that a terminal
solution for this restricted model was obtained, where #122* = 0. This
result, when coupled with the two a priori zero restrictions, produced a
zero expected count in the (5, 1) cell. This implies that a modification of
the model’s df would be required. To make H; for the British data com-
parable to Hz for the Danish data, an expedient was adopted to circumvent
this difficulty. The observed count of zero for the (5, 1) cell was replaced
by .1, and the two-class model was then reestimated. While this strategy is
admittedly ad hoc in character, there can be little question that the modifi-
cation just described can have little effect on the interpretation of results.®
Model H; applied to this modified British 5 X 5 table produces L*(H2) =
182.3, A = 8.0%, R? = .78. When sample size is taken into account, the
fit of Hz is thus comparable for both the British and the Danish 5 X 5
tables. The estimated proportion in the upper class is .246 (compared with
.385 for the Danish table). Later analysis will show that this apparent
difference in the size of the upper class is due almost entirely to status
inheritance unaccounted for by the two-class model Ho.

Upon applying the two-class model to the British 8 X 8 table, the same
kind of difficulty was encountered as when it was applied to the 5 X 5
table. A value of .1 was added to both of the cell zeroes; a proper nonter-
minal solution to the likelihood function was then obtained, yielding positive
expected frequencies for all cells. Model Hz produces an L? of 253.5, A =
9.3%, R? = .73, for the 8 X 8 table, results that are nearly comparable to
the results for both the British 5 X 5 table and the Danish 5 X 5 table.
Under Hy» for the British 8 X 8 table, the estimated proportion in the
upper class was .228, compared with .246 for this model applied to the
5 X 5 British table.
data, H; is one natural modification of that model to consider. However,
there are difficulties in the application of the three-class model to mobility
tables as well, and these will now be discussed, first with reference to the
Danish 5 X 5 table. As noted previously, there are 24 nonredundant 7,,;,
and equation (3) thus defines a transformation from the model parameters
to these 24 7;;. For the three-class model, there are apparently two non-
redundant 7,*, 12 nonredundant wi*, and 12 nonredundant 1jPX, pro-
ducing an apparent total of 26 parameters. Since the number of parameters
is two greater than the number of nonredundant 7,;, the parameters of the
three-class model are clearly underidentified unless some restrictions are
imposed. It is easy to see that at least two restrictions are required, and
when two restrictions of the kind used in connection with Hz are imposed
(see table 3) the fit of the model is equivalent to that obtained for the
completely unrestricted model, L?(H3) = 32.7, A = 5.0%. However, it
can be shown that, even with two restrictions, the parameter estimates are
still unidentifiable, and it can be further shown that two additional restric-
tions are required. In other words, the three-class model has 2 df when
applied to the 5 X 5 mobility table, and this demonstrates why the fit of
the model is not perfect. The three-class model does improve the fit, but it
is clearly not parsimonious. Moreover, it still does not fit the data to an
acceptable degree as judged by any of the indexes of fit. Because of these
facts, we are led to consider various kinds of restricted latent structures,
some of which are surveyed in the next section.

Results from H3 applied to the other tables also appear in table 2. While
a moderate improvement in fit was obtained with each set of mobility data,
there is clearly room for improvement. One must conclude that general
latent structures of the kind which would initially be considered in an
analysis of mobility have failed to fit the data to an acceptable degree.
Inspection of standardized residuals for each of the models considered here
shows that “clustering” along the main diagonal is the main reason for the
failure of these models. The tendency for at least some individuals to stay
in their origin status is thus not adequately taken into account by either
the perfect mobility model H; or the two- and three-class models Hz and
Hs. (See Singer and Spilerman [1978] for a recent discussion of this problem
and for references cited there.)
This section applies some restricted latent structures to the data with the
objectives of both testing the models and arriving at the substantive
implications of them for the structure of mobility. All of these models can
be viewed as generalizations of either or both of the latent structures Hy
and H». We will find that it is not necessary to consider generalizations of
H;, the three-class latent structure.

The quasi-perfect mobility model considered by Goodman (1969, 1972)
is a restricted latent structure, as indicated by the discussion surrounding
(12)-(13). This model is an (I + 1)-class restricted latent structure, with
I-deterministic status classes, or categories of “latent stayers,” and an
additional single class of latent movers. Within the latent mover class,
mobility is posited to be perfectly random, depending only on the distribu-
tion of the origin and destination statuses within this class. For each of the
I statuses, a group is posited to exist which stays in the status with certainty,
and it is this feature of the model which leads us to characterize the I
groups of latent stayers as constituting distinct status classes. Mobility
across statuses is prohibited for members of each status class, giving the
justification for the term “class,” and each of these groups consists of
members of only one status, giving the reason why this is referred to as a
status class. This model is designated as M, in table 5, and we see clearly
that it does not fit any of the sets of data. (The A’s, e.g., range from 6.6%
to 10.1%.) It can be noted that this model is roughly comparable in terms
of its fit with the two-class model Hz considered in the previous section; M;
fits less well but is slightly more parsimonious. A variety of modifications
of M, have been considered in the literature (e.g., Goodman 1969, 1972,
1979; Haberman 1974; Pullum 1975; Hauser 1978; Duncan 1979), but, to
my knowledge, none of the various generalizations have considered the
type of extension to which we now turn.

the x? statistics were taken as pertaining to simple random samples (i.e.,
multinomial samples) or to stratified random samples with the destination
statuses as the stratifying criterion (ie., product-multinomial samples),
the descriptive level of significance for M3 would be greater than .20 for
the Danish table and only slightly less than .05 for the British table.

Models M, and M; posit four and five status classes, respectively, and
contribute nothing to fit. The estimated proportions of latent stayers in
statuses 2 and 4 turn out to be nearly zero for each set of data, given that
latent stayers are admitted for statuses 1, 3, and 5. Model Mg considers the
possibility that latent stayers in status 1 can be deleted from model M3,
but for each set of data it is clear that this cannot be considered tenable.
Model Ms; thus appears as a plausible model for both 5 X 5 tables, and
there appear to be no serious competitors involving either more or fewer
status classes than the three considered with M3.

We next consider similar models for the British 8 X 8 table, namely,
models M’, and M’;. Model M’, modifies the two-class model by positing
the existence of seven status classes (a status class corresponding to status
3 was omitted). Model M’; is the model with all eight status classes con-
sidered, and we see that this does not improve the fit to any discernible
extent. Model M”’, is thus the quasi-latent structure suggested for the 8 X 8
table. It fits the data less well than M; applied to the 5 X 5 tables and
would stil] be judged inadequate if the x? statistics were taken at face
value. However, M’s accounts for 94% of the variability in the table, has
a A of 4.1% and an F of only 2.1, implying that the model performs very
well indeed when compared with any of the other models considered in
this paper. It can be noted that Duncan (1979) obtained a somewhat
better fit for the 8 X 8 table with his row-effects and his uniform-association
model, with the diagonal “deleted” (L? = 45.9, 58.4 on 34 and 40 df,
respectively), but his model is developed from an entirely different point of
view than the models considered here (also see Goodman 1979). Duncan
examined the dependence of destination status on origin status and formu-
lated coefficients somewhat analogous to the simple regression coefficient
Boo in the fashion of status attainment research (cf. Blau and Duncan
1967). I have focused analysis directly on the class structure of mobility
processes, taking the variable X as the intervening variable which explains
the dependence of destination on origin. While the fit of M’, can certainly
be improved, inspection of the R? or A indexes indicate that only a little
improvement is necessary.

* The meaning of the latent classes is as follows: classes 1 and 2
refer to latent upper and latent lower classes, respectively; classes
3, 4, and 5 refer to latent status classes corresponding to latent
stayers in observed statuses 1, 3, and 5, respectively.

+ Denotes a restriction.
latent stayers in status 3 (.059/.014), and roughly equal numbers who are
latent stayers in the fifth status. These results correspond to 25%, 20%, and
27% of those in origin statuses 1, 3, and 5 being latent stayers in Denmark,
and 32%, 10%, and 26% in Britain. In both absolute and relative terms,
the differences observed between the two sets of data with respect to the
latent class distribution arise because of differing tendencies for status
inheritance in the first and third statuses.

The conditional probabilities #,°*, #;2* corresponding to M; are also
presented in table 6 and allow comparison of the status distributions within
classes between the two sets of data. A salient difference is that the third
status is much more likely to depict membership in the upper class for
Denmark (since #ts9X = .342 for Denmark, as compared with .178 for
Britain). The reader can note that OX > #2°* for i = 1, 2, 3, whereas
#iOX < #.°* for i = 4, 5, with a similar ordering for the #;*, for each
set of estimates. Latent class 1, the upper class, is therefore essentially a
mixture of statuses 1, 2, 3, and latent class 2, the lower class, is essentially
a mixture of statuses 4 and 5 for each society.

Tables 7 and 8 present the parameter estimates for model M’, for the
British 8 X 8 table. Alongside these are the corresponding estimates for
model M3 applied to the 5 X 5 table. One question to be raised is how the
descriptions offered by the models change when a less coarse summary of
the mobility data is used instead of a coarse summary. In table 7 the latent
class proportions are compared. The proportion in the latent upper class is
estimated at .236 in the 8 X 8 table, compared with .220 in the 5 X 5
table; the proportion in the latent lower class is estimated at .680 in the
8 X 8 table, compared with .691 in the 5 X 5 table. These differences are
relatively slight. The estimated proportions in the status classes differ
somewhat for the two tables. Introducing the finer detail changes the
inference, for example, for each of the status classes associated with observed
statuses 5-8. In the 8 X 8 table, .018 of the persons (compared with .000
for the 5 X 5 table) are estimated to stay in statuses 5 or 6, and .033 (com-
pared with .062) are estimated to stay in statuses 7 or 8. In spite of these
differences, I do not believe that these results should be used in an ad hoc
way to determine whether the 5 X 5 or the 8 X 8 table should be the focus
of the analysis. The question which table should be used is largely a non-
statistical question and should be resolved by the researcher when he
decides which forms of mobility or immobility are important to consider.
Table 8 presents the estimates OX , tt PX for the 8 X 8 table and compares
them with the corresponding quantities obtained from model M3 applied
to the 5 X 5 table. Some differences in interpretation are again observed,
but on balance I believe the reader will find that both sets of estimates
produce nearly the same characterization of the latent class variable and
the relationship of it to the status variables O and D.

In sum, the two-class quasi-latent structure has provided compelling sum-
maries of all three sets of mobility data, and the parameter estimates lend
themselves easily to substantive interpretation. The logical relationships
among these models can be depicted as in figure 2. The perfect mobility
model, which states that there is only one class in the table within which
there are random mobility chances, can be generalized into both the quasi-
perfect mobility model My, by adding concepts of status classes, and the
fundamentally different model H2, a two-class latent structure. The models
considered by Goodman (1972), Haberman (1974), Pullum (1975), Duncan
(1979), and Hauser (1978), for example, can all be viewed as generalizations
of H, and/or M;. However, the quasi-latent structures M2-M, (as well as
M’,, M’s) are all direct generalizations of Hz, where two classes of latent
movers are posited to exist. The results presented here certainly suggest
that models combining the features of Hz and M, should be given serious
consideration.
as well as by Goodman (1969). One difficulty in the earlier literature was
that comparisons of the observed numbers staying in a status over time
were implicitly made with the expected numbers staying in that status
given the perfect mobility model, a model which on the whole did not fit
the data to an acceptable degree wherever it was applied. Goodman pro-
posed that immobility be measured with the quasi-perfect mobility model
M;,, where explicit parameters measuring immobility were incorporated as
a feature of the model (see eqq. [12]-[13] herein). Model M; does not fit
these data, but the quasi-latent structure did fit the data to an acceptable
degree, and so it seems altogether appropriate to base measures of im-
mobility upon it. The indexes of immobility y,* presented in (16)—(17) can
be used to measure the surplus of stayers in status i, relative to that pre-
dicted to stay in status 7 given the operation of random mobility chances
within both the latent upper and the latent lower class of “movers.” In
table 9, Goodman’s indexes of immobility 7; obtained from Mj are compared
with the indexes of immobility 7;* obtained from M; for the 5 X 5 tables
and M”, for the 8 X 8 table.

In virtually every case, the amount of immobility in the statuses of the
mobility tables is greatly reduced when the 7;* of (16) are used as measures.
The comparisons are dramatic in some instances; for example, Goodman’s
index 41 = 11.26 and the revised index 41* = 5.05 for the Danish table.
That is, under the quasi-perfect mobility model the observed number of
stayers in status 1 is 11.26 times greater than the expected immobility. in
this status predicted from the marginals for the single latent mover class.
On the other hand, the revised index says that the observed number of
stayers in status 1 is 5.05 times greater than would be expected from the
prediction obtained from the marginals for both of two latent classes of
movers. With the two-class quasi-latent structure, an accounting must be
The Prediction of Membership in Latent Classes and Latent Status Classes

When the two-class quasi-latent structure is used to describe the data, the
model parameters can be manipulated to provide the prediction of latent
class membership for any mobility pattern in the table. This technique was
discussed in equations (4)—(8) and was illustrated with the two-class model
H, for the Danish data in table 4. I shall now describe the latent class
predictions for all three sets of data based on models that fit. The only
difference between these predictions and those presented earlier is that now
status classes must be taken into account.

Table 10 summarizes the predictions for the two 5 X 5 tables. The most
salient feature of this comparison is the striking degree of similarity in
results, as can be seen in several ways. First, the predictions are identical
for each table, with the single exception of the prediction for the (4, 2)
mobility pattern. With the Danish data (table 10A) the (4, 2) pattern of
mobility is sufficient to produce a prediction of membership in the upper
class (with an error rate of .33), while for the British data (table 10B) this
same pattern of mobility produces a prediction of lower-class membership
(with an error rate of .45). Interpreted in another way this says that, under
the model, 67% of the persons with this pattern of mobility would be
predicted to be members of the upper class in Denmark, while only 45%
would be predicted to be in the upper class in Britain. I remarked earlier
that Britain appears to have a slightly heavier concentration in the lower
class, and this characteristic shows up in the prediction for this particular
mobility pattern. As a whole, the quality of the prediction is comparable
for each table: 82.9% and 83.7% of the persons would be correctly allocated
to the latent classes and latent status classes for Denmark and Britain,
respectively, and the \ measures of the quality of the prediction are also
comparable. (From [8] it is clear that \ takes into account the distribution
of the latent classes, i.e., the relative magnitudes of the #,*, whereas the
“percent correctly allocated” is based only on the quantity EZ» of eq. [6],
and this accounts for why the two indexes give slightly different interpreta-
tions of the quality of the predictions.) The upper- versus lower-class
division in both tables is comparable, with the division occurring approxi-
mately on the diagonal of the table that runs from the lower left to the
upper right.

Table 10 also provides us with the error rates associated with the pre-
dictions of membership in the three status classes associated with M3. For
example, the error rate of .20 for the (1, 1) cell for the Danish table signifies
that 80% of the observed stayers in status 1 can be regarded as latent
stayers or members of a status class associated with the first observed
status. A similar argument shows that 87% of the stayers in status 1 for
the British table can be regarded as latent stayers. As a direct consequence
of the model, it is easy to see that all other members of the (1, 1) mobility
pattern besides those in the associated status class are members of the latent
upper class, and this is a consequence of the fact that the restriction 7.°* =
0 was applied. Since this holds, it appears appropriate further to charac-
terize the status class associated with the first origin status as a status class
embedded within the upper class. To corroborate this interpretation, merely
note that all mobility patterns adjacent to the (1, 1) cell produce predictions
of membership in the upper class, and note in addition that membership
in the first origin status denotes either membership in the status class just
discussed or in the upper class. Because of these considerations, it seems
justified to speak of the first latent status class as a special category within
the upper class, an interpretation that certainly accords well with intuition.
Similar comments apply directly to the characterization of the status class
corresponding to latent stayers in the fifth status. We are led to characterize
this status class (denoted as class 5 in table 10) as a status class within the
lower class, and this designation is a consequence of the fact that all mem-
bers of origin status 5 are predicted to be in either the lower class or the
latent status class for this status, and/or the fact that all mobility patterns
adjacent to the (5, 5) cell are predicted to be in the lower class. A similar
interpretation cannot be made for the status class corresponding to the
third observed status, since (a) those not in the relevant status class (de-
noted as class 4 in table 10) might be in either the upper or the lower class,
and (8) the mobility patterns adjacent to the (3, 3) cell produce predictions
of both upper- and lower-class membership, depending on the direction in
which one moves from this cell. The status class corresponding to latent
stayers in observed status 3 is thus intermediate between the upper and
lower classes indirectly observed in the table. In sum, there is an appealing
simplicity in the predictions of table 10, which may be summarized in the
following way: (1) two latent classes exist, an upper and a lower class; (2)
Table 10. Assignment of Mobile and Nonmobile Persons

into Latent Classes, Based on Model My for
Danish and British 5x5 Tables
three status classes exist; and (3) two status classes are embedded within
the two latent classes of the model, and a third status class straddles the
two latent classes.

For purposes of comparison, table 11 presents the latent class predictions
for the British 8 X 8 table. In overall quality, the predictions are similar
to those made with the corresponding 5 X 5 table, although some differ-
ences in interpretation do arise. Note, for example, that the (7, 1) and the
(2, 7), (2, 8) patterns produce a prediction of upper-class membership
with the model M’, applied to the 8 X 8 table, whereas earlier results
based on the 5 X 5 table would have indicated that these would produce a
prediction of lower-class membership. Again, the reader should be cautioned
that inference about the 8 X 8 table is qualitatively different from inference
about the 5 X 5 table, and the choice of which is to be preferred is largely
a nonstatistical question. On balance, however, the two predictions are
Markov-Type Transition Rates Based on the Quasi-latent Structure

In equation (10), it was shown how the general latent class model for the
wiz could be translated into a model for the mobility rates 7;;, and this
corresponded to a Markov-type assumption about the transition from
status 7 to latent class ¢, and from latent class ¢ to destination status 7.
Let R denote the matrix of mobility rates, let U denote the J X T matrix
of transition probabilities 7:°% (see [9]), and let V denote the T X I
matrix of transition probabilities 1;*. Then (10) implies that R = UV,
and for a particular model (e.g., Ms), the estimated expected mobility
rates can be written as R = UV. The transition matrices U and V appear
IV. CONCLUSION

The argument throughout this paper has been that the general latent
structure model can be used to considerable advantage in the analysis of
mobility tables. These methods are consistent with a variety of important
conceptual paradigms that have been developed for the mathematical and
statistical analysis of mobility. Similarities between the framework presented
here and a regression framework are obvious: the latent structure method
seeks to characterize the variable that intervenes between origin and
destination in the mobility table, and this is somewhat analogous to the
objectives of status attainment research generally. It was also pointed out
how the latent structure framework leads to the development of a quasi-
latent structure, a model similar to the influential quasi-perfect mobility
model considered at length by Goodman. Finally, the Markov character of
the latent structure model was discussed, demonstrating the conceptual
similarity between the approach used here and certain approaches based
on discrete-state stochastic processes. It was found that three classic sets of
mobility data, which have been analyzed extensively over the past 20
years, could be adequately described by a quasi-latent structure. This
model says that (a) two latent classes exist, an upper and a lower class,
each of which is a mixture of the observed statuses in the table; (6) these
latent classes derive their meaning as classes because within them mobility
is “perfect” or random, structured only by the status distribution at origin
and destination within each class; and (c) status classes corresponding to
latent stayers in some of the statuses could also be posited to exist, and
these can account for the excessive immobility typically found in some
diagonal cells of the mobility table. It is my view that the latent structure
framework allows a more direct integration of traditional sociological
concepts of class into mobility analysis than any approach hitherto directed
to the analysis of mobility tables. For practical purposes, the statistical
characterization of the classes of the latent variable X might be taken as a
summary of the (sociological) class variable that explains the observed
dependence of destination on origin. These are certainly bold claims, but
I should be hard pressed to devise another framework depicting class
structure as well as the approach advocated herein.®

However, certain technical issues must be resolved if the exploratory
analysis reported on here is to be used in more theoretically enlightening
“confirmatory” analyses, or in comparative mobility analyses with current
data. Estimation of parameters in the latent structure model has long been
a difficult problem (cf. Lazarsfeld and Henry 1968), but the methods
described by Goodman (1974a) circumvent these difficulties. The computer
program used in all of the calculations (Clogg 1977) is suggested as one
approach to efficient computation, but different methods surveyed by
Haberman (1979) or Clogg (19808) could be used with equal justification.
A more difficult problem arises from the fact that parameters are unidentifi-
able for many of the models considered here; all of the empirical deductions
from the models depend on the proper resolution of the identification
problem. To simplify the present exposition, very simple identifying restric-
tions were imposed, but no amount of ad hoc specification of the models
can circumvent this problem in a satisfactory way. I believe that the zero
restrictions on two conditional probabilities used herein, which effectively
define the highest origin status as exclusively upper class in character and
the lowest origin status as exclusively lower class in character, represent
plausible strategies for researchers to follow.
